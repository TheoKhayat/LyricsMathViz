some porn or have sex on the phone far from people i hate down from anywhere state trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party and then i saw her standing there with green eyes and long blond hair she wasnt wearing underwear at least i prayed that she might be the one maybe wed have some fun maybe wed watch the sun rise but that night i learned some girls try too hard some girls

her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless so i said id call her but never would bother until i got turned down by another girl at a party so when you see her standing there with green eyes and long blonde hair she wont be wearing underwear and youll discover this girls not the one and shell never be fun you should just turn and run because youll find out that some girls try too hard some

cause youre the only thing that matters cause youre the only thing thats real cause youre the only thing ill never let go cause youre the only thing i feel someday youll come back to me and ill say something bitterly and youll go racing toward the kitchen grab a knife erase my vision take my flatscreen television and my paintings by marilyn manson cause youre the only thing that matters cause

this cool room chill long hair that blows side to side you speak and make time stand still and each time walk right on by like violence you have me forever and after like violence you kill me forever and after cant count all the eyes that stare cant count all the things they see she kills with no life to spare just victims left to bleed one drink and the pain goes down soft shadows lay by her feet lay soft as you slowly drown lay still while you fall asleep fall asleep like violence you have me forever and after like violence you kill me forever and after and after and after and after like violence you have me forever and after like violence you kill me like violence you have me forever and after like violence you kill me like violence you have me forever and after like violence you kill me forever and after like violence you have me forever and after like violence you kill me forever and after push it out fake a smile avert disaster just in time i need a drink cause in a while worthless answers from friends of mine its dumb to ask cool to ignore girls possess me but theyre never mine i made my entrance avoided hazards checked my engine i fell behind i fell behind she makes me feel like its raining outside and when the storms gone im all torn up inside im always nervous on days like this like the prom i get too scared to move cause im a fuckin boy remember when i was in the grocery store nows my time lost the words lost the nerve lost the girl left the line i would wish upon a star but that star it doesnt shine so read my book with a boring ending a short story of a lonely guy who fell behind she makes me feel like its raining outside and when the storms gone im all torn up inside im always nervous on days like this like the prom i get too scared to move cause im a fuckin boy she makes me feel like its raining outside and when the storms gone im all torn up inside im always nervous on days like this like the prom i get too scared to move cause im still just a stupid worthless boy she didnt mean to deceive you believe me but sometimes the hardest part is conceiving the good intentions that you had now only came to this and although she saw the mark the arrow missed it isnt exciting reciting the stories of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring both getting tired of punk rock clubs and both playing in punk rock bands the start was something good but some good things must end and she said it could never survive with such differing lives one home one out on tour again we may never come back the strike of a match the candles burning at both ends and now she knows too much and im too fucked up its awkward trying to make my move ill pretend that im fine show up right on time but i know ill never be that cool i never wanted to hold you back i just wanted to hold on but my chance is gone i know just where i stand a boy trapped in the body of a man and ill take what youre willing to give and ill teach myself to live with a walk on part of a background shot from a movie im not in shes so important and im so retarded and now i realize i should have kissed you in la but i drove home all alone as if i had a choice anyway where are you coming from what are you running from is it so hard to see and if youre feeling scared remember the time we shared you know it meant everything everything you know that it meant everything to me you know that it meant everything to me i think of awhile ago we might have had it all but i was so stupid then you needed time to grow but now just as things change as well my feelings do in time things rearrange i am so sick of chasing you but what do i get cause i just seem to lose you make me regret those times i spent with you and playing those games a i wait for your call and now i give up so goodbye and so long its not a change of pace this time ill get it right its not a change of taste i was the one there last night you have your other friends they were there when you cried didnt mean to hurt you then best friends just wont leave your side but what do i get cause i just seem to lose you make me regret those times i spent with you and playing those games as i wait for your call and now i give up so goodbye and so long its not a change of pace this time ill get it right its not a change of taste i was the one there last night when i needed you most when i needed a friend you let me down now like i let you down then so sorry its over ah one thing  i dont know why it doesnt even matter how hard you try keep that in mind  i designed this rhyme to explain in due time all i know time is a valuable thing watch it fly by as the pendulum swings watch it count down to the end of the day the clock ticks life away its so unreal didnt look out below watch the time go right out the window trying to hold on  but didnt even know wasted it all just to watch you go i kept everything inside and even though i tried  it all fell apart what it meant to me  will eventually  be a memory  of a time when i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter one thing  i dont know why it doesnt even matter how hard you try keep that in mind  i designed this rhyme to remind myself how i tried so hard in spite of the way you were mocking me acting like i was part of your property remembering all the times you fought with me im surprised it got so far things arent the way they were before you wouldnt even recognize me anymore not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end you kept everything inside and even though i tried  it all fell apart what it meant to me  will eventually  be a memory  of a time when i i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter ive put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go for all this theres only one thing you should know ive put my trust in you pushed as far as i can go for all this theres only one thing you should know i tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter i had to fall to lose it all but in the end it doesnt even matter i saw you again i think you used me again should we try this before we give up and move on and pretend to restore what we have and hold on at times like these its obvious i saw you again i know you fucked him again can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge are you leaving me here with the taste of the end at times like these its obvious at times like these its obvious i saw you again and again and again theres some room to move on to move on to move on and i saw you again and again and again how do we fix this if we never have vision i saw you again and again and again theres some room to move on to move on to move on and i saw you again and again and again how do we fix this if we never have vision i saw you again and again and again theres some room to move on to move on to move on and i saw you again and again and again how do we fix this if we never have vision i saw you again and again and again theres some room to move on to move on to
