wooden crutch he said to me you must not ask for so much and a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door she cried to me hey why not ask for more oh like a bird on the wire like a drunk in a midnight choir i have tried in my way to be free its true that all the men you knew were dealers who said they were through with dealing every time you gave them shelter i know that kind of man its hard to hold the hand of anyone who is reaching for the sky just to surrender who is reaching for the sky just to surrender and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild hell never need to deal another he was just some joseph looking for a manger he was just some joseph looking for a manger and then leaning on your window sill hell say one day you caused his will to weaken with your love and warmth and shelter and then taking from his wallet an old schedule of trains hell say i told you when i came i was a stranger but now another stranger seems to want you to ignore his dreams as though they were the burden of some other oh youve seen that man before his golden arm dispatching cards but now its rusted from the elbows to the finger and he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter ah you hate to see another tired man lay down his hand like he was giving up the holy game of poker and while he talks his dreams to sleep you notice theres a highway that is curling up like smoke above his shoulder its curling just like smoke above his shoulder you tell him to come in sit down but something makes you turn around the door is open you cant close your shelter you try the handle of the road it opens do not be afraid its you my love you who are the stranger it is you my love you who are the stranger well ive been waiting i was sure wed meet between the trains were waiting for i think its time to

realize hes only advertising one more shelter and it comes to you he never was a stranger and you say okay the bridge or someplace later and then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind you find he did not leave you very much not even laughter like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild hell never need to deal another he was just some joseph looking for a manger he was

penitential hymn come healing of the spirit come healing of the limb behold the gates of mercy in arbitrary space and none of us deserving the cruelty or the grace o solitude of longing where love has been confined come healing of the body come healing of the mind o see the darkness yielding that tore the light apart come healing of the reason come healing of the heart o troubled dust concealing an undivided love the heart beneath is teaching to the broken heart above let the heavens falter let the earth proclaim come healing of the altar come healing of the name o longing of the branches to lift the little bud o longing of the arteries to purify the blood and let the heavens hear it the penitential hymn come healing of the spirit come healing of the limb o let the heavens hear it the penitential hymn come healing of the spirit come healing of the limb now the flames they followed joan of arc as she came riding through the dark no moon to keep her armour bright no man to get her through this very smoky night she said im tired of the war i want the kind of work i had before a wedding dress or something white to wear upon my swollen appetite well im glad to hear you talk this way you know ive watched you riding every day and something in me yearns to win such a cold and lonesome heroine and who are you she sternly spoke to the one beneath the smoke why im fire he replied and i love your solitude i love your pride then fire make your body cold im going to give you mine to hold saying this she climbed inside to be his one to be his only bride and deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of joan of arc and high above the wedding guests he hung the ashes of her wedding dress it was deep into his fiery heart he took the dust of joan of arc and then she clearly understood if he was fire oh then she must be wood i saw her wince i saw her cry i saw the glory in her eye myself i long for love and light but must it come so cruel and oh so bright did i ever love you did i ever need you did i ever fight you did i ever want to did i ever leave you was i ever able or are we still leaning across the old table was it ever settled was it ever over and is it still raining back in november the lemon trees blossom the almond trees whither was i ever someone who could love you forever did i ever love you does it really matter did i ever fight you you dont need to answer did i ever leave you was i ever able and are we still leaning across the old table getting sick of starting over on the same argument we could sit around and talk it over or take a trip to clear our minds at the entrance of mount wilson its feeling like the right decision some times you go outside to get inside if i could only hear you say that you are down but youre ok we should have said the things we felt is it too late park the car and hit the trail the air feels sharp on our skin well see the snow as it is melting spring must be on her way again we didnt see her coming for us i guess thats mother natures way sometimes you go outside to get inside if i could only hear you say that you are down but youre ok we should have said the things we felt is it too late trapped beneath the wall of snow youre only ten feet away silence has a way of speaking only now do we understand if i could only hear you say that you are down but youre ok we should have said the things we felt is it too late i lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me but the room just filled up with mosquitoes they heard that my body was free then i took the dust of a long sleepless night and i put it in your little shoe and then i confess that i tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through i showed my heart to the doctor he said id just have to quit then he wrote himself a prescription your name was mentioned in it then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon and i hear from the nurse that hes gotten much worse and his practice is all in a ruin i heard of a saint who had loved you i studied all night in his school he taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule and just when i was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in the pool his body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool an eskimo showed me a movie hed recently taken of you the poor man could hardly stop shivering his lips and his fingers were blue i suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes and i guess he just never got warm but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice oh please let me come into the storm sometimes i find i get to thinking of the past we swore to each other then our love would surely last you kept right on loving i went on a fast now i am too thin and your love is too vast but i know from your eyes and i know from your smile that tonight will be fine will be fine will be fine will be fine for a while i choose the rooms that i live in with care the windows are small and the walls almost bare theres only one bed and theres only one prayer i listen all night for your step on the stair but i know from your eyes and i know from your smile that tonight will be fine will be fine will be fine will be fine for a while oh sometimes i see her undressing for me shes the soft naked lady love meant her to be and shes moving her body so brave and so free if ive got to remember thats a fine memory and i know from her eyes and i know from her smile that tonight will be fine will be fine will be fine will be fine for a while and i know and i know and i know suddenly the night has grown colder the god of love preparing to depart alexandra hoisted on his shoulder they slip between the sentries of the heart upheld by the simplicities of pleasure they gain the light they formlessly entwine and radiant beyond your widest measure they fall among the voices and the wine its not a trick your senses all deceiving a fitful dream the morning will exhaust say goodbye to alexandra leaving then say goodbye to alexandra lost even though she sleeps upon your satin even though she wakes you with a kiss do not say the moment was imagined do not stoop to strategies like

moonlight sonata backwards this will reverse the effects of the worlds mad plunge into suffering for the last two hundred million years what a lovely night that would be what a sigh of relief as the senile robins become bright red again and the retired nightingales pick up their dusty tails and assert the majesty of creation maybe im still hurting i cant turn the other cheek but you know that i still love you its just that i cant speak i looked for you in everyone and they called me on that too i lived alone but i was only coming back to you ah theyre shutting down the factory now just when all the bills are due and the fields theyre under lock and key tho the rain and the sun come through and springtime starts but then it stops in the name of something new and all the senses rise against this coming back to you and theyre handing down my sentence now and i know what i must do another mile of silence while im coming back to you there are many in your life and many still to be since you are a shining light theres many that youll see but i have to deal with envy when you choose the precious few whove left their pride on the other side of coming back to you even in your arms i know ill never get it right even when you bend to give me comfort in the night ive got to have your word on this or none of it is true and all ive said was just instead of coming back to you i remember you well in the chelsea hotel you were talking so brave and so sweet giving me head on the unmade bed while the limousines wait in the street those were the reasons and that was new york we were running for the money and the flesh and that was called love for the workers in song probably still is for those of them left ah but you got away didnt you babe you just turned your back on the crowd you got away i never once heard you say i need you i dont need you i need you i dont need you and all of that jiving around i remember you well in the chelsea hotel you were famous your heart

smaller the lake a ladys mirror we stopped to drink some wine then he threw the bottle over broke a minute later and he put his hand on mine thought i saw an eagle but it might have been a vulture i never could decide then my father built an altar he looked once behind his shoulder he knew i would not hide you who build these altars now to sacrifice these children you must not do it anymore a scheme is not a vision and you never have been tempted by a demon or a god you who stand above them now your hatchets blunt and bloody you were not there before when i lay upon a mountain and my

i lived my life in babylon and i did forget my holy song and i had no strength in babylon by the rivers dark where i could not see who was waiting there who was hunting me and he cut my lip and he cut my heart so i could not drink from the river dark and he covered me and i saw within my lawless heart and my wedding ring i did not know and i could not see who was waiting there who was hunting me by the rivers dark i panicked on i belonged at last to babylon then he struck my heart with a deadly force and he said âthis heart it is not yours and he gave the wind my wedding ring and he circled us with everything by the rivers dark in a wounded dawn i live my life in babylon though i take my song from a withered limb both song and tree they sing for him be the truth unsaid and the blessing gone

i left so much behind my patience and my family my masterpiece unsigned i thought id be rewarded for such a lonely choice and surely she would answer to such a very hopeless voice i practiced all my sainthood i gave to one and all but the rumors of my virtue they moved her not at all i changed my style to silver i changed my clothed to black and where i would surrender now i would attack i stormed the old casino for the money and the flesh and i myself decided what was rotten and what was fresh and men to do my bidding and broken bones to teach the value of my pardon the shadow of my reach but no i could not touch her with such a heavy hand her star beyond my order her nakedness unmanned i came so far for beauty i left so much behind my patience and my family my masterpiece
