background i have mine thank you i have mine thank you baby black is gold is pure and true kings of this earth one so i say its up to us to straighten out this mess we got to go through hell and then thats the last of this miserable test two black must be bold because its gold and true kings of this world so let them go to the moon yes let them go to mars because deep down inside theyre really from the stars three thats why they dont want us to mixjust the way the word of god had said so let them go to saturnthats where theyll learn instead because black and white together is right and white by itself is an egotistic elf four so they show you how to killand if you dont they will what do they know about happiness how can they about life they just got lost in space so when they landed atlantis cried so if theyre so alone try to make them feel at home so let them fetch you fire wood and let them nibble on the bone so invent a word called love and then they blame our mistakes on god dont you know how lonely they must be so many light years from home hey soulful people im calling dont be no more slaves because god will protect us when it comes to doomsday realize before its too late that no one on earth will escape we are the kings of earth and axis gonna put them slaves they killed so many worlds before but they will pass sentence upon themselves when the earth opens upwill they be saved from our hell i feel the truth of life we better all realize people like me and you we feel so bad dont know what to do they keep us high low on drugs and they got us making their rugs as we go dripping blood but the sun knows as the wind blows and the fire grows towards the far shores and the water foams to make steamed bones of all of those who dont belive that black is gold is the kings of this world we all better get our places before god tells us to our face we arepast the human race lets pray that we all agree we got to straighten out the family tree life is for you and me togather thats the way it was meant to be white man watch your mouth because our drums they face the south and you cant kill the god that kept you alive between the poles of the north and south you better adjust your place in this worldbefore your hair it starts to curland the yellow red and black of this world will tear your ass and soul apart where is he coming from  from heaven where one million worlds are one where is he going to  hes going to make contact with the living and the dead here comes black gold gather round young and old hes going to be felt by the timid and the bold within a wink of an eye with the wink of an eye egos swell bust and die kingdoms fall and cry with the wink of an eye with the wink of an eye a new born baby cries and a one hundred soldiers die with the wink of an eye
