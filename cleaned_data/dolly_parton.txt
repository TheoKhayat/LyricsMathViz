to the seasons of my youth i recall a box of rags that someone gave us and how my momma put the rags to use there were rags of many colors and every piece was small and i didnt have a coat and it was way down in the fall momma sewed the rags together sewin every piece with love she made my coat of many colors that i was so proud of as she sewed she told a story from the bible she had read about a coat of many colors joseph wore and then she said perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness and i just couldnt wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss my coat of many colors that my momma made for me made only from rags but i wore it so proudly although we had no money oh i was rich as i could be in my coat of many colors my momma made for me so with patches on my britches holes in both my shoes in my coat of many colors i hurried off to school just to find the others laughing and making fun of me and my coat of many colors my momma made for me and oh i couldnt understand that for i thought i was rich and then i told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch and i told em all the story momma told me while she sewed and why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes they didnt understand it and i tried to make them see one is only poor only if you choose to be it is true we had no money but i was rich as i could be in my coat of many colors momma made for me made just for me i could hold out my arms say i love you this much i could tell you how long i will long for your touch how much and how far would i go to prove the depth and the breadth of my love for you from here to the moon and back who else in this world will love you like that love everlasting i promise you that from here to the moon and back from here to the

half in fear the day would find the soldiers breakin through to drag us all away and just before the sunrise i heard something at the wall the gate began to rattle and a voice began to call i hurried to the window looked down into the street expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet but there was no one there but mary so i went down to let her in john stood there beside me as she told me where shed been she said theyve moved him in the night and none of us know where the stones been rolled away and now his body isnt there we both ran towards the garden then john ran on ahead we found the stone and empty tomb just the way that mary said but the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell and how or where theyd taken him was more than i could tell oh something strange had happened there just what i did not know john believed a miracle but i just turned to go circumstance and speculation couldnt lift me very high cause id seen them crucify him then i saw him die back inside the house again the guilt and anguish came everything id promised him just added to my shame when at last it came to choices i denied i knew his name and even if he was alive it wouldnt be the same but suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room and jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide and i fell down on my knees and i just clung to him and cried then he raised me to my feet and as i looked into his eyes the love was shining out from him like sunlight from the skies guilt in my confusion disappeared in sweet release and every fear i ever had just melted into peace hes alive yes hes alive yes hes alive and im forgiven heavens gates are open wide hes alive yes hes alive oh hes alive and im forgiven heavens gates are open wide hes alive hes alive hallelujah hes alive hes alive and im forgiven heavens gates are open wide hes alive hes alive hes alive i believe it hes alive

those tennessee homesick blues runnin through my head tennessee homesick blues i remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton when our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings winter cares which were already few or soon forgotten just sittin on the front porch swing oh we sit every sunday and watched the married ladies and we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring and they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies sittin on the front porch swing where was i when the time came to join the married ladies why did i paint the nail when the finger had no ring why do i sit at night at my age to hold their baby sittin on the front porch swing when the mind longs to follow but the memory erases and the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings when the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces sittin on the front porch swing oh well dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton when our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings but the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten sittin on the front porch swing sittin on the front porch swing people always comin up to me and
