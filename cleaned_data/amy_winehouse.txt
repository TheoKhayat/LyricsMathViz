happened to you nobody knows where my johnny has gone but judy left the same time why was he holding her hand when hes supposed to be mine play all my records keep dancing all night but leave me alone for a while till johnnys dancing with me ive got no reason to smile judy and johnny just walked through that door like a queen with her king oh what a birthday surprise judys wearing his ring lent you outsiders and my new badu while you were thinking i didnt have a clue tough to sort files with your voice in my head so then i bribed you downstairs with a marlboro red and now i feel so small discovering you knew how much more torture would you have put me through you probably saw me laughing at all your jokes or how i did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah and although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb with your battered jeans and your beastie tee now i cant work like this with you next to me and although hes nothing in the scheme of my years it just serves to bludgeon my futile tears and im not use to thisno no i observe i dont chase so now im stuck with consequences thrust in my face and the melodramas of my day delivery blows and that surpass your rejection it just goes to show a simple attraction that reflects right back to me so im not as into you as i appear to be and although my prides not easily disturbed you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb with your battered jeans and your beastie tee yeah yeah now i cant work like this with you next to me yeah yeah his message was brutal but the delivery was kind maybe if i get this down ill get it off my mind it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks despite my frustration for the way that he thinks and i knew the truth when it came would be to that effect at least youre attracted to me which i did not expect didnt think you get my number down as such but i never hated myself for my age so much yeah and although my prides yeah not easily disturbed yeah you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb so with your battered jeans yeah and your beastie tee now i cant work like this no with you next to me and although my prides yeah not easily disturbed yeah you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb so with your battered jeans yeah and your beastie tee now i cant work like this no with you next to me
