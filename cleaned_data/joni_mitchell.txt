inside a jar fearful when the sky was full of thunder and tearful at the falling of a star and the seasons they go round and round and the painted ponies go up and down were captive on the carousel of time we cant return we can only look behind from where we came and go round and round and round in the circle game then the child moved ten times round the seasons skated over ten clear frozen streams words like when youre older must appease him and promises of someday make his dreams and the seasons they go round and round and the painted ponies go up and down were captive on the carousel of time we cant return we can only look behind from where we came and go round and round and round in the circle game sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town and they tell him take your time it wont be long now till you drag your feet to slow the circles down and the seasons they go round and round and the painted ponies go up and down were captive on the carousel of time we cant return we can only look behind from where we came and go round and round and round in the circle game so the years spin by and now the boy is twenty though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true therell be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty before the last revolving year is through and the seasons they go round and round and the painted ponies go up and

the players lick their wounds and take their temporary lovers and their pills and powders to get them through this passion play no regrets coyote i just get off up aways you just picked up a hitcher a prisoner of the white lines on the freeway coyotes in the coffee shop hes staring a hole in his scrambled eggs he picks up my scent on his fingers while hes watching the waitresses legs hes too fat

to get ourselves back to the garden then can i walk beside you i have come here to lose the smog and i feel to be a cog in something turning well maybe it is just the time of year or maybe its the time of man i dont know who l am but you know life is for learning we are stardust we are golden and weve got to get ourselves back to the garden by the time we got to woodstock we were half a million strong and everywhere there was song and celebration and i dreamed i saw the bombers riding shotgun in the sky and they were turning into butterflies above our nation we are stardust billion year old carbon we are golden caught in the devils bargain and weve got to get ourselves back to the garden im traveling in some vehicle im sitting in some cafe a defector from the petty wars that shell shocked love away theres comfort in melancholy when theres no need to explain its just as natural as the weather in this moody sky today in our possessive coupling so much could not be expressed so now im returning to myself these things that you and i suppressed i see something of myself in everyone just at this moment of the world as snow gathers like bolts of lace waltzing on a ballroom girl you know it never has been easy whether you do or you do not resign whether you travel the breadth of extremities or stick to some straighter line now heres a man and a woman sitting on a rock theyre either going to thaw out or freeze listenstrains of benny goodman coming through the snow and the pinewood trees im porous with travel fever but you know im so glad to be on my own still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger can set up trembling in my bones i know no ones going to show me everything we all come and go unknown each so deep and superficial between the forceps and the stone well i looked at the granite markers those tribute to finality to eternity and then i looked at myself here chicken scratching for my immortality in the church they light the candles and the wax rolls down like tears theres the hope and the hopelessness ive witnessed thirty years were only particles of change i know i know orbiting around the sun but how can i have that point of view when im always bound and tied to someone white flags of winter chimneys waving truce against the moon in the mirrors of a modern bank from the window of a hotel room im traveling in some vehicle im sitting in some cafe a defector from the petty wars until love sucks me back that way my analyst told me that i was right out of my head the way he described it he said id be better dead than live i didnt listen to his jive i knew all along that he was all wrong and i knew that he thought i was crazy but im not oh no my analyst told me that i was right out of my head he said id need treatment but im not that easily led he said i was the type that was most inclined when out of his sight to be out of my mind and he thought i was nuts no more ifs or ands or buts they say as a child i appeared a little bit wild with all my crazy ideas but i knew what was happening i knew i was a genius whats so strange when you know that youre a wizard at three i knew that this was meant to be now i heard little children were supposed to sleep tight thats why i got into the vodka one night my parents got frantic didnt know what to do but i saw some crazy scenes before i came to now do you think i was crazy i may have been only three but i was swinging they all laugh at angry young men they all laugh at edison and also at einstein so why should i feel sorry if they just couldnt understand the idiomatic logic that went on in my head i had a brain it was insane oh they used to laugh at me when i refused to ride on all those double decker buses all because there was no driver on the top my analyst told me that i was right out of my head but i said dear doctor i think that its you instead because i have got a thing thats unique and new to prove it ill have the last laugh on you cause instead of one head i got two and you know two heads are better than one woke up it was a chelsea morning and the first thing that i heard was a song outside my window and the traffic wrote the words it came a reeling up like christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums oh wont you stay well put on the day and well wear it till the night comes woke up it was a chelsea morning and the first thing that i saw was the sun through yellow curtains and a rainbow on the wall blue red green and gold to welcome you crimson crystal beads to beckon oh wont you stay well put on the day theres a sun show every second now the curtain opens on a portrait of today and the streets are paved with passersby and pigeons fly and papers lie waiting to blow away woke up it was a chelsea morning and the first thing that i knew there was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges too and the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses oh wont you stay well put on the day and well talk in present tenses when the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away i will bring you incense owls by night by candlelight by jewel light if only you will stay pretty baby wont you wake up its a chelsea morning i was driving across the burning desert when i spotted six jet planes leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain it was the hexagram of the heavens it was the strings of my guitar amelia it was just a false alarm the drone of flying engines is a song so wild and blue it scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you then your life becomes a travelogue of picture post card charms amelia it was just a false alarm people will tell you where theyve gone theyll tell you where to go but till you get there yourself you never really know where some have found their paradise others just come to harm oh amelia it was just a false alarm i wish that he was here tonight its so hard to obey his sad request of me to kindly stay away so this is how i hide the hurt as the road leads cursed and charmed i tell amelia it was just a false alarm a ghost of aviation she was swallowed by the sky or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly like icarus ascending on beautiful foolish arms amelia it was just a false alarm maybe ive never really loved i guess that is the truth ive spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude and looking down on everything i crashed into his arms amelia it was just a false alarm i pulled into the cactus tree motel to shower off the dust and i slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust i dreamed of 747s over geometric farms dreams amelia dreams and false alarms i went to staten island to buy myself a mandolin and i saw the long white dress of love on a storefront mannequin big boat chuggin back with a belly full of cars all for something lacy some girls going to see that dress and crave that day like crazy little indian kids on a bridge up in canada they can balance and they can climb like their fathers before them theyll walk the girders of the manhattan skyline shine your light on me miss liberty because as soon as this ferry boat docks im headed to the church to play bingo fleece me with the gamblers flocks i can keep my cool at poker but im a fool when loves at stake because i cant conceal emotion what im feelings always written on my face theres a gypsy down on bleecker street i went in to see her as a kind of joke and she lit a candle for my love luck and eighteen bucks went up in smoke sharon i left my man at a north dakota junction and i came out to the big apple here to face the dreams malfunction loves a repetitious danger youd think id be accustomed to well i do accept the changes at least better than i used to do a woman i knew just drowned herself the well was deep and muddy she was just shaking off futility or punishing somebody my friends were calling up all day yesterday all emotions and abstractions it seems we all live so close to that line and so far from satisfaction dora says have children mama and betsy say find yourself a charity help the needy and the crippled or put some time into ecology well theres a wide wide world of noble causes and lovely landscapes to discover but all i really want right now is find another lover when we were kids in maidstone sharon i went to every wedding in that little town to see the tears and the kisses and the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown and walking home on the railroad tracks or swinging on the playground swing love stimulated my illusions more than anything and when i went skating after golden reggie you know it was white lace i was chasing chasing dreams mamas nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans he showed me first you get the kisses and then you get the tears but the ceremony of the bells and lace still veils this reckless fool here now there are twenty nine skaters on wolmann rink circling in singles and in pairs in this vigorous anonymity a blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares and the power of reason and the flowers of deep feeling seem to serve me only to deceive me sharon youve got a husband and a family and a farm ive got the apple of temptation and a diamond snake around my arm but you still have your music and ive still got my eyes on the land and the sky you sing for your friends and your family ill walk green pastures by and by again and again the same situation for so many years tethered to a ringing telephone in a room full to mirrors a pretty girl in your bathroom checking out her sex appeal i asked myself when you said you loved me do you think this can be real still i sent up my prayer wondering where it had to go with heaven full of astronauts and the lord on death row while the millions of his lost and lonely ones call out and glamour to be found caught in their struggle for higher positions and their search for love that sticks around youve had lots of lovely women now you turn your gaze to me weighing the beauty and the imperfection to see if im worthy like the church like a cop like a mother you want me to be truthful sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though and i need your approval still i sent up my prayer wondering who was there to hear i said send me somebody whos strong and somewhat sincere with the millions of the lost and lonely ones i called out to be released caught in my struggle for higher achievements and my search for love that dont seem to cease look out the left the captain said the lights down there thats where well land i saw a falling star burn up above the las vegas sands it wasnt the one that you gave to me that night down south between the trailers not the early one that you can wish upon not the northern one that guides in the sailors oh star bright star bright youve got the lovin that i like all right turn this crazy bird around i shouldnt have got on this flight tonight you got the touch so gentle and sweet but youve got that look so critical now i cant talk to you baby i get so weak sometimes i think love is just mythical up theres a heaven down theres a town blackness everywhere and little lights shine oh blackness blackness dragging me down come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine oh star bright star bright youve got the lovin that i like all right turn this crazy bird around i shouldnt hove got on this flight tonight im drinking sweet champagne got the headphones up high cant numb you out cant drum you out of my mind theyre playing goodbye baby baby goodbye ooh ooh love is blind up go the flaps down go the wheels i hope you got your heat turned on baby i hope they finally fixed your automobile i hope its better when we meet again baby star bright star bright you got the lovin that i like all right turn this crazy bird around i shouldnt have got on this flight tonight theres a man whos been out sailing in a decade full of dreams and he takes her to a schooner and he treats her like a queen bearing beads from california with their amber stones and green he has called her from the harbor he has kissed her with his freedom he has heard her off to starboard in the breaking and the breathing of the water weeds while she was busy being free theres a man whos climbed a mountain and hes calling out her name and he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles he calls again he can think her there beside him he can miss her just the same he has missed her in the forest while he showed her all the flowers and the branches sang the chorus as he climbed the scaley towers of a forest tree while she was somewhere being free theres a man whos sent a letter and hes waiting for reply he has asked her of her travels since the day they said goodbye he writes wish you were beside me we can make it if we try he has seen her at the office with her name on all his papers through the sharing of the profits he will find it hard to shake her from his memory and shes so busy being free theres a lady in the city and she thinks she loves them all theres the one whos thinking of her theres the one who sometimes calls theres the one who writes her letters with his facts and figures scrawl she has brought them to her senses they have laughed inside her laughter now she rallies her defenses for she fears that one will ask her for eternity and shes so busy being free theres a man who sends her medals he is bleeding from the war theres a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store theres a drummer and a dreamer and you know there may be more she will love them when she sees them they will lose her if they follow and she only means to please them and her heart is full and hollow like a cactus tree while shes so busy being free i pulled up behind a cadillac we were waiting for the light and i took a look at his license plate it said just ice is justice just ice governed by greed and lust just the strong doing what they can and the weak suffering what they must oh and the gas leaks and the oil spills and sex sells everything

underdog position cellars and chittlins when lester took him a wife arm and arm went black and white and some saw red and drove them from their hotel bed love is never easy its short of the hope we have for happiness bright and sweet love is never easy street now we are black and white embracing out in the lunatic new york night its very unlikely well be driven out of town or be hung in a tree thats unlikely tonight these crowds are happy and loud children are up dancing in the streets in the sticky middle of the night summer serenade of taxi horns and fun arcades where right or wrong under neon every feeling goes on for you and me the sidewalk is a history book and a circus dangerous clowns balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions they have been handed day by day generations on down we came up from the subway on the music midnight makes to charlies bass and lesters saxophone in taxi horns and brakes now charlies down in mexico with the healers so the sidewalk leads us with music to two little dancers dancing outside a black bar theres a sign up on the awning it says pork pie hat bar and theres black babies dancing tonight dont interrupt the sorrow darn right in flames our prophet witches be polite a room full of glasses he says your notches liberation doll and he chains me with that serpent to that ethiopian wall anima rising queen of queens wash my guilt of eden wash

madonna clandestine he dont let up the sorrow he lies and he cheats it takes a heart like marys these days when your man gets weak varnished weeds in window jars tarnished beads on tapestries kept in satin boxes are reflections of loves memories letters from across the seas roses dipped in sealing wax valentines and maple leaves tucked into a paperback guess ill throw them all away i found someone to love today dark with darker moods is he not a golden prince whos come through columbines and wizardry to talk of castles in the sun still ill take a chance and see i found someone to love today theres a sorrow in his eyes like the angel made of tin what will happen if i try to place another heart in him in a bleeker street cafe i found someone to love today i found someone to love today i am a woman of heart and mind with time on her hands no child to raise you come to me like a little boy and i give you my scorn and my praise you think im like your mother or another lover or your sister or the queen of your dreams or just another silly girl when love makes a fool of me after the rush when you come back down youre always disappointed nothing seems to keep you high drive your bargains push your papers win your medals fuck your strangers dont it leave you on the empty side im looking for affection and respect a little passion and you want stimulation nothing more thats what i think but you know ill try to be there for you when your spirits start to sink all this talk about holiness now it must be the start of the latest style is it all books and words or do you really feel it do you really laugh do you really care do you really smile when you smile you criticize and you flatter you imitate the best and the rest you memorize you know the times you impress me most are the times when you dont try when you dont even try a strange boy is weaving a course of grace and havoc on a yellow skateboard through midday sidewalk traffic just when i think hes foolish and childish and i want him to be manly i catch my fool and my child needing love and understanding what a strange strange boy he still lives with his family even the war and the navy couldnt bring him to maturity he keeps referring back to school days and clinging to his child fidgeting and bullied his crazy wisdom holding onto something wild he asked me to be patient well i failed grow up i cried and as the smoke was clearing he said give me one good reason why what a strange strange boy he sees the cars as sets of waves sequences of mass and space he sees the damage in my face we got high on travel and we got drunk on alcohol and on love the strongest poison and medicine of all see how that feeling comes and goes like the pull of moon on tides now i am surf rising now parched ribs of sand at his side what a strange strange boy i gave him clothes and jewelry i gave him my warm body i gave him power over me a thousand glass eyes were staring in a cellar full of antique dolls i found an old piano and sweet chords rose up in waxed new england halls while the boarders were snoring under crisp white sheets of curfew we were newly lovers then we were fire in the stiff blue haired house rules im don juans reckless daughter i came out two days on your tail those two bald headed days in november before the first snowflakes sail out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery a split tongue spirit talks noble as a nickel chief striking up an old juke box and he says snakes along the railroad tracks he says eagles in jet trails he says coils around feathers and talons on scales gravel under the belly plates he says wind in the wings he says big bird dragging its tail in the dust snake kite flying on a string i come from open prairie given some wisdom and a lot of jive last night the ghosts of my old ideas reran on channel five and it howled so spooky for its eagle soul i nearly broke down and cried but the split tongue spirit laughed at me he says your serpent cannot be denied our serpents love the whisky bars they love the romance of the crime but didnt i see a neon sign fester on your hotel blind and a country road come off the wall and swoop down at the crowd at the bar and put me at the top of your danger list just for being so much like you are youre a coward against the altitude youre a coward against the flesh coward caught between yes and no reckless this time on the line for yes yes yes reckless brazen in the play of your changing traffic lights coward slinking down the hall to another restless night as we center behind the eight ball as we rock between the sheets as we siphon the colored language off the farms and the streets here in good old god save america the home of the brave and the free we are all hopelessly oppressed cowards of some duality of restless multiplicity oh say can you see restless for streets and honky tonks restless for home and routine restless for country safety and her restless for the likes of reckless me restless sweeps like fire and rain over virgin wilderness it prowls like hookers and thieves through bolt locked tenements behind my bolt locked door the eagle and the serpent are at war in me the serpent fighting for blind desire the eagle for clarity what strange prizes these battles bring these hectic joys these weary blues puffed up and strutting when i think i win down and shaken when i think i lose there are rivets up here in this eagle there are box cars down there on your snake and we are twins of spirit no matter which route home we take or what we forsake were going to come up to the eyes of clarity and well go down to the beads of guile there is danger and education in living out such a reckless life style i touched you on the central plains it was plane to train my twin it was just plane shadow to train shadow but to me it was skin to skin the spirit talks in spectrums he talks to mother earth to father sky self indulgence to self denial man to woman scales to feathers you and i eagles in the sky you and i snakes in the grass you and i crawl and fly you and i words and music by isham jones and gene willaden one thousand, nine hundred and forty two so heres

warmth and beauty you settle for less than fascination a few drinks later youre not so choosy when the closing lights strip off the shadows on this strange new flesh youve found clutching the night to you like a fig leaf you hurry to the blackness and the blankets to lay down an impression and your loneliness in the morning there are lovers in the street they look so high you brush against a stranger and you both apologize old friends seem indifferent you must have brought that on old bonds have broken down love is gone ooh love is gone written on your spirit this sad song love is gone

then it gobbled summer down when the sun turns traitor cold and all trees are shivering in a naked row i get the urge for going but i never seem to go i get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown summertime is falling down and winter is closing in i had me a man in summertime he had summer colored skin and not another girl in town my darlings heart could win but when the leaves fell on the ground and bully winds came around pushed them face down in the snow he got the urge for going and i had to let him go he got the urge for going when the meadow grass was turning brown and summertime was falling down and winter was closing in now the warriors of winter they gave a cold triumphant shout and all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out see the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow theyve got the urge for going and theyve got the wings so they can go they get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown summertime is falling down and winter is closing in ill ply the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin ill lock the vagrant winter out and ill bolt my wandering in id like to call back summertime and have her stay for just another month or so but shes got the urge for going so i guess shell have to go she get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown and all her empires are falling down and winters closing in and i get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown and summertime is falling down the story hit the news from coast to coast they said you beat the girl you loved the most your charitable acts seemed out of place with the beauty with your fist marks on her face your buddies all stood by they bet their fortunes and their fame that she was out of line and you were not to blame six hundred thousand doctors are putting on rubber gloves and theyre poking at the miseries made of love they say theyre learning how to spot the battered wives among all the women they see bleeding through their lives i bleed for your perversity these red words that make a stain on your white washed claim that she was out of line and you were not to blame i heard your baby say when he was only three daddy lets get some girls one for you and one for me his mother had the frailty you despise and the looks you love to drive to suicide not one wet eye around her lonely little grave said he was out of line girl you were not to blame when morning comes to morgantown the merchants roll their awnings down the milktrucks make their morning rounds in

my frightened silence thinking i dont understand i feel like im sleeping can you wake me you seem to have a broader sensibility im just living on nerves and feelings with a weak and a lazy mind and coming to peoples parties fumbling deaf dumb and blind i wish i had more sense of humor keeping the sadness at bay throwing the lightness on these things laughing it all away laughing it all away laughing it all away i met a friend of spirit he drank and womanized and i sat before his sanity i was holding back from crying he saw my complications and he mirrored me back simplified and we laughed how our perfection would always be denied heart and humor and humility he said will lighten up your heavy load i left him for the refuge of the roads i fell in with some drifters cast upon a beach town winn dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs and i wound up fixing dinner for them and boston jim i well up with affection thinking back down the roads to then the nets were overflowing in the gulf of mexico they were overflowing in the refuge of the roads there was spring along the ditches there were good times in the cities oh radiant happiness it was all so light and easy till i started analyzing and i brought on my old ways a thunderhead of judgment was gathering in my gaze and it made most people nervous they just didnt want to know what i was seeing in the refuge of the roads i pulled off into a forest crickets clicking in the ferns like a wheel of fortune i heard my fate turn turn turn and i went running down a white sand road i was running like a white assed deer running to lose the blues to the innocence in here these are the clouds of michelangelo muscular with gods and sungold shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads in a highway service station over the month of june was a photograph of the earth taken coming back from the moon and you couldnt see a city on that marbled bowling ball or a forest or a highway or me here least of all you couldnt see these cold water restrooms or this baggage overload westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads turning and turning within the widening gyre the falcon cannot hear the falconer things fall apart the center cannot hold and a blood dimmed tide is loosed upon the world nothing is sacred the ceremony sinks innocence is drowned in anarchy the best lack conviction given some time to think and the worst are full of passion without mercy surely some revelation is at hand surely its the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form for what is this rough beast its hour come at last slouching towards bethlehem to be born slouching towards bethlehem to be born hoping and hoping as if by my weak faith the spirit of this world would heal and rise vast are the shadows that straddle and strafe and struggle in the darkness troubling my eyes shaped like a lion it has the head of a man with a gaze as blank and pitiless as the sun and its moving its slow thighs across the desert sands through dark indignant reeling falcons surely some revelation is at hand surely its the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form for what is this rough beast its hour come at last slouching towards bethlehem to be born slouching towards bethlehem to be born raging and raging it rises from the deep opening its eyes after twenty centuries vexed to a nightmare out of a stony sleep by a rocking cradle by the sea of galilee surely some revelation is at hand surely its the second coming and the wrath has finally taken form for what is this rough beast its hour come at last slouching towards bethlehem to be born slouching towards bethlehem to be born if theres one rule to this game everybodys gonna name its be cool if youre worried or uncertain if your feelings are

applause did you get a round resounding for you way up here seems like many dim years ago since i heard that face to face so seen you face to face though tonight i can feel you here i get these notes on butterflies and lilac sprays from girls who just have to tell me they saw you somewhere in some office sits a poet and he trembles as he sings and he asks some guy to circulate his soul around on your mark red ribbon runner the caressing rev of motors finely tuned like fancy women in thirties evening gowns up the charts off to the airport your names in the news everythings first class the lights go down and its just you up there getting them to feel like that remember the days when you used to sit and make up your tunes for love and pour your simple sorrow to the sound hole and your knee and now youre seen on giant screens and at parties for the press and for people who have slices of you from the company they toss around your latest golden egg speculation well whos to know if the next one in the nest will glitter for them so i guess i seem ungrateful with my teeth sunk in the hand that brings me things i really cant give up just yet now i sit up here the critic and they introduce some band but they seem so much confetti looking at them on my tv set oh the power and the glory just when youre getting a taste for worship they start bringing out the hammers and the boards and the nails i heard it in the wind last night it sounded like applause chilly now end of summer no more shiny hot nights it was just the arbutus rustling and the bumping of the logs and the moon swept down black water like an empty spotlight once in a while in a big blue moon there comes a night like this like some surrealist invented this fourth of july night ride home hula girls and caterpillar tractors in the sand the ukulele man the fireworks this 4th of july night ride home i love the man beside me we love the open road no phones till friday far from the overkill far from the overload back at the bar the band tears down but out here in the headlight beams the silver power lines gleam on this fourth of july night ride home round the curve and a big dark horse red taillights on his hide is keeping right alongside rev for stride fourth of july night ride home i love the man beside me we love the open road no phones till friday far from the undertow far from the overload once in awhile in a big blue moon there comes a night like this like some surrealist invented this fourth of july night ride home night ride home night ride home on a night ride home on a night ride home night ride home although i speak in tongues of men and angels im just sounding brass and tinkling cymbals without love love suffers long love is kind enduring all things love has no evil in mind if i had the gift of prophecy and all the knowledge and the faith to move the mountains even if i understood all of the mysteries if i didnt have love id be nothing love never looks for love loves not puffed up or envious or touchy because it rejoices in the truth not in iniquity love sees like a child sees as a child i spoke as a child i thought and i understood as a child but when i became a woman i put away childish things and began to see through a glass darkly where as a child i saw it face to face now i only know it in part fractions in me of faith and hope and love and of these great three loves the greatest beauty love love love i was in an all night movie when i heard the usher say here comes the midnight cowboy got his gun hired out for pay you were walking kind of faded from

own one day and i sing one love have i and he sings now its goodbye and i sing part of me dies until i see you again who has seen the sun through a parasol of leaves through scattered ruby cloud fires through the silver wings of bees i have said the waters and i held his face to mine but he left in time he went in his own good time who has seen the stranger in a coat of simple brown with his face of many faces with his eyes turned out of town i have and i kissed him and i begged him please to stay but he went away with the sun and the wind away where to begin to end uncertainty do i leave silently or boldly say farewell how can i think of times that used to be and find the smile i need to wish you well but i wont cry for dusty memories no i wont cry for dreams that couldnt be no i wont cry the daffodils the sorry candlelight to buy my heart when loveless words were spoken too many tears to welcome in the night too many promises the days have broken so i wont cry for kisses out of

to aging children come aging children i am one people hurry by so quickly dont they hear the melodies in the chiming and the clicking and the laughing harmonies songs to aging children come aging children i am one some come dark and strange like dying crows and ravens whistling lines of weeping strings of crying so much said in listening songs to aging children come aging children i am one

sunday she dodges the light like blanche dubois bright colors fade away on such a sunny sunday she waits for the night to fall then she points a pistol through the door and she aims at the streetlight while the freeway hisses dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor the streetlights still burning she always misses but the day she hits thats the day shell leave that one little victory thats all she needs she pulls the shade its just another sunny monday she waits for the night to fall out on some borderline some mark of in between i lay down golden in time and woke up vanishing sweet bird you are briefer than a falling star all these vain promises on beauty jars somewhere with your wings on time you must be laughing behind our eyes calendars of our lives circled with compromise sweet bird of time and change you must be laughing up on your feathers laughing golden in time cities under the sand power ideals and beauty fading in everyones hand give me some time i feel like im losing mine out here on this horizon line with the earth spinning and the sky forever rushing no one knows they can never get that close guesses at most guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching fly silly seabird no dreams can possess you no voices can blame you for sun on your wings my gentle relations have names they must call me for loving the freedom of all flying things my dreams with the seagulls fly out of reach out of cry i came to the city and lived like old crusoe on an island of noise in a cobblestone sea and the beaches were concrete and the stars paid a light bill and the blossoms hung false on their store window trees my dreams with the seagulls fly out of reach out of cry out of the city and down to the seaside to sun on my shoulders and wind in my hair but sandcastles crumble and hunger is human and humans are hungry for worlds they cant share my dreams with the seagulls fly out of reach out of cry i call to a seagull who dives to the waters and catches his silver fine dinner alone crying where are the footprints that danced on these beaches and the hands that cast wishes that sunk like a stone my dreams with the seagulls fly out of reach out of cry every picture has its shadows and it has some source of light blindness blindness and sight the perils of benefactors the blessings of parasites blindness blindness and sight threatened by all things devil of cruelty drawn to all things devil of delight mythical devil of the ever present laws governing blindness blindness and sight suntans in reservation dining rooms pale miners in their lantern rays night night and day hostage smile on presidents freedom scribbled in the subway its like night night and day threatened by all things god of cruelty drawn to all things god of delight mythical god of the everlasting laws governing day day and night critics of all expression judges in black and white saying its wrong saying its right compelled by prescribed standards or some ideals we fight for wrong wrong and right threatened by all things man of cruelty mark of cain drawn to all things man of delight born again born again man of the laws the ever broken laws governing wrong wrong and right governing wrong wrong and right wrong and right twinkle twinkle what a pity all alone on such a pretty night with enchantment on your side popcorn popcorn cotton candy soft voice whispers this can all be right if youll come and share a ride carnival in kenora i let him take me for a ride on a giant ferris wheel up in the neon sky or far from the barkers cry one kiss can sometimes make you feel like a spinning ferris wheel all the tents are taken down now all thats left is scuffled ground now still the magic echoes in the sand popcorn popcorn cotton candy now a stranger takes my hand we smile and the magic understands carnival in kenora i let him take me for a ride on a giant ferris wheel up in the neon sky or far from the barkers cry one kiss can sometimes make you feel like a spinning ferris wheel out of the fire like catholic saints comes scarlett and her deep complaint mimicking tenderness she sees in sentimental movies a celluloid rider comes to town cinematic lovers sway plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns take her breath away out in the wind in crinolines chasing the ghosts of gable and flynn through stand in boys and extra players magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair she comes from a school of southern charm she likes to have things her way any man in the world holding out his arm would soon be made to pay friends have told her not so proud neighbors trying to sleep and yelling not so loud lovers in anger block of ice harder and harder just to be nice given in the night to dark dreams from the dark things she feels she covers her eyes in the x rated scenes running from the reels beauty and madness to be praised cause it is not easy to be brave to walk around in so much need to carry the weight of all that greed dressed in stolen clothes she stands cast iron and frail with her impossibly gentle hands and her blood red fingernails out of the fire and still smoldering she says a woman must have everything shades of scarlett conquering she says a woman must have everything tomorrow is sunday now theres only one day

whitewalls and windshields and this job hes got and you want to get moving and you want to stay still but lost in the moment some longing gets filled and you even forget to ask hey wheres barangrill rousseau walks on trumpet paths safaris to the heart of all that jazz through i bars and girders through wires and pipes the mathematic circuits of the modern nights through huts through harlem through jails and gospel pews through the class on park and the trash on vine through europe and the deep deep heart of dixie blue through savage progress cuts the jungle line in a low cut blouse she brings the beer rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear those cannibals of shuck and jive theyll eat a working girl like her alive with his hard edged eye and his steady hand he paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines and he hangs a moon above a five piece band he hangs it up above the jungle line the jungle line the jungle line screaming in a ritual of sound and time floating drifting on the air conditioned wind and drooling for a taste of something smuggled in pretty women funneled through valves and smoke coy and bitchy wild and fine and charging elephants and chanting slaving boats charging chanting down the jungle line theres a poppy wreath on a soldiers tomb theres a poppy snake in a dressing room poppy poison poppy tourniquet it slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit and metal skin and ivory birds go steaming up to rousseaus vines they go steaming up to brooklyn bridge steaming steaming steaming up the jungle line it was a rainy night we took a
