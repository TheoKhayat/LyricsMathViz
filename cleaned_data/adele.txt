begin and end with me i want to see your face in every kind of light in the fields of dawn and the forests of the night and when you stand before the candles on a cake oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes in the world of love that you keep in your eyes ill awaken whats asleep in your eyes it may take a kiss or two through all of my life
