gonna dress in drag only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove lot of water under the bridge lot of other stuff too dont get up gentlemen im only passing through people are crazy and times are strange im locked in tight im out of range i used to care but things have changed ive been walking forty miles of bad road if the bible is right the world will explode ive been trying to get as far away from myself as i can some things are too hot to touch the human mind can only stand so much you cant win with a losing hand feel like falling in love with the first woman i meet putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street people are crazy and times are strange im locked in tight im out of range i used to care but things have changed i hurt easy i just dont show it

who dont even appeal to me mr jinx and miss lucy they jumped in the lake im not that eager to make a mistake people are crazy and times are strange im locked in tight im out of range i used to care but things have changed darkness at the break of noon shadows even the silver spoon the handmade blade the childs balloon eclipses both the sun and moon to understand you know too soon there is no sense in trying pointed threats they bluff with scorn suicide remarks are torn from the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn plays wasted words proves to warn that he not busy being born is busy dying temptations page flies out the door you follow find yourself at war watch waterfalls of pity roar you feel to moan but unlike before you discover that youd just be one more person crying so dont fear if you hear a foreign sound to your ear its alright ma im only sighing as some warn victory some downfall private reasons great or small can be seen in the eyes of those that call to make all that should be killed to crawl while others say dont hate nothing at all except hatred disillusioned words like bullets bark as human gods aim for their mark make everything from toy guns that spark to flesh colored christs that glow in the dark its easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred while preachers preach of evil fates teachers teach that knowledge waits can lead to hundred dollar plates goodness hides behind its gates but even the president of the united states sometimes must have to stand naked an though the rules of the road have been lodged its only peoples games that you got to dodge and its alright ma i can make it advertising signs they con you into thinking youre the one that can do whats never been done that can win whats never been won meantime life outside goes on all around you you lose yourself you reappear you suddenly find you got nothing to fear alone you stand with nobody near when a trembling distant voice unclear startles your sleeping ears to hear that somebody thinks they really found you a question in your nerves is lit yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy insure you not to quit to keep it in your mind and not forget that it is not he or she or them or it that you belong to although the masters make the rules for the wise men and the fools i got nothing ma to live up to for them that must obey authority that they do not respect in any degree who despise their jobs their destinies speak jealously of them that are free cultivate their flowers to be nothing more than something they invest in while some on principles baptized to strict party platform ties social clubs in drag disguise outsiders they can freely criticize tell nothing except who to idolize and then say god bless him while one who sings with his tongue on fire gargles in the rat race choir bent out of shape from societys pliers cares not to come up any higher but rather get you down in the hole that hes in but i mean no harm nor put fault on anyone that lives in a vault but its alright ma if i cant please him old lady judges watch people in pairs limited in sex they dare to push fake morals insult and stare while money doesnt talk it swears obscenity who really cares propaganda all is phony while them that defend what they cannot see with a killers pride security it blows the minds most bitterly for them that think deaths honesty wont fall upon them naturally life sometimes must get lonely my eyes collide head on with stuffed graveyards false gods i scuff at pettiness which plays so rough walk upside down inside handcuffs kick my legs to crash it off say okay i have had enough what else can you show me and if my thought dreams could be seen theyd probably put my head in a guillotine but its alright ma its life and life only im walking through streets that are dead walking walking with you in my head my feet are so tired my brain is so wired and the clouds are weeping did i hear someone tell a lie did i hear someones distant cry i spoke like a child you destroyed me with a smile while i was sleeping im sick of love but im in the thick of it this kind of love im so sick of it i see i see lovers in the meadow i see i see silhouettes in the window i watch them til theyre gone and they leave me hanging on to a shadow im sick of love i hear the clock tick this kind of love im love sick sometimes the

broken cars dont know what to do without it without this love that we call ours beyond here lies nothin nothin but the moon and stars down every street theres a window and every window made of glass well keep on lovin pretty baby for as long as love will last beyond here lies nothin but the mountains of the past my ship is in the harbor and the sails are spread listen to me pretty baby lay your hand upon my head beyond here lies nothin nothin done and nothin said twas in another lifetime one of toil and blood when blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud i came in from the wilderness a creature void of form come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm and if i pass this way again you can rest assured ill always do my best for her on that i give my word in a world of steel eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved everything up to that point had been left unresolved try imagining a place where its always safe and warm come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm i was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail poisoned in the bushes an blown out on the trail hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm suddenly i turned around and she was standin there with silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair she walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm now theres a wall between us somethin theres been lost i took too much for granted got my signals crossed just to think that it all began on a long forgotten morn come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount but nothing really matters much its doom alone that counts and the one eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm ive heard newborn babies wailin like a mournin dove and old men with broken teeth stranded without love do i understand your question man is it hopeless and forlorn come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm in a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes i bargained for salvation an they gave me a lethal dose i offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm well im livin in a foreign country but im bound to cross the line beauty walks a razors edge someday ill make it mine if i could only turn back the clock to when god and her were born come in she said ill give you shelter from the storm ramona come closer shut softly your watery eyes the pangs of your sadness shall pass as your senses will rise the flowers of the city though breathlike get deathlike at times and theres no use in tryin t deal with the dyin though i cannot explain that in lines your cracked country lips i still wish to kiss as to be under the strength of your skin your magnetic movements still capture the minutes im in but it grieves my heart love to see you tryin to be a part of a world that just dont exist its all just a dream babe a vacuum a scheme babe that sucks you into feelin like this i can see that your head has been twisted and fed by worthless foam from the mouth i can tell you are torn between stayin and returnin on back to the south youve been fooled into thinking that the finishin end is at hand yet theres no one to beat you no one t defeat you cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad ive heard you say many times that youre better n no one and no one is better n you if you really believe that you know you got nothing to win and nothing to lose from fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem that hype you and type you making you feel that you must be exactly like them id forever talk to you but soon my words they would turn into a meaningless ring for deep in my heart i know there is no help i can bring everything passes everything changes just do what you think you should do and someday maybe who knows baby ill come and be cryin to you my love she speaks like silence without ideals or violence she doesnt have to say shes faithful yet shes true like ice like fire people carry roses make promises by the hours my love she laughs like the flowers valentines cant buy her in the dime stores and bus stations people talk of situations read books repeat quotations draw conclusions on the wall some speak of the future my love she speaks softly she knows theres no success like failure and that failures no success at all the cloak and dagger dangles madams light the candles in ceremonies of the horsemen even the pawn must hold a grudge statues made of matchsticks crumble into one another my love winks she does not bother she knows too much to argue or to judge the bridge at midnight trembles the country doctor rambles bankers nieces seek perfection expecting all the gifts that wise men bring the wind howls like a hammer the night blows cold and rainy my love shes like some raven at my window with a broken wing you got a lotta nerve to say you are my friend when i was down you just stood there grinning you got a lotta nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend you just want to be on the side thats winning you say i let you down you know its not like that if youre so hurt why then dont you show it you say you lost your faith but thats not where its at you had no faith to lose and you know it i know the reason that you talk behind my back i used to be among the crowd youre in with do you take me for such a fool to think id make contact with the one who tries to hide what he dont know to begin with you see me on the street you always act surprised you say how are you good luck but you dont mean it when you know as well as me youd rather see me paralyzed why dont you just come out once and scream it no i do not feel that good when i see the heartbreaks you embrace if i was a master thief perhaps id rob them and now i know youre dissatisfied with your position and your place dont you understand its not my problem i wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes and just for that one moment i could be you yes i wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes youd know what a drag it is to see you i cant understand she let go of my hand an left me here facing the wall id sure like t know why she did go but i cant get close t her at all though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime

him from the courtroom and were taking him away my trip hasnt been a pleasant one and my time it isnt long and i still do not know what it was that ive done wrong well the judge he cast his robe aside a tear came to his eye you fail to understand he said why must you even try outside the crowd was stirring you could hear it from the door inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more oh stop that cursed jury cried the attendant and the nurse the trial was bad enough but this is ten times worse just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape and while evrybody knelt to pray the drifter did escape when youre lost in the rain in juarez and its eastertime too and your gravity fails and negativity dont pull you through dont put on any airs when youre down on rue morgue avenue they got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outta you now if you see saint annie please tell her thanks a lot i cannot move my fingers are all in a knot i dont have the strength to get up and take another shot and my best friend my doctor wont even say what it is ive got sweet melinda the peasants call her the goddess of gloom she speaks good english and she invites you up into her room and youre so kind and careful not to go to her too soon and she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon up on housing project hill its either fortune or fame you must pick up one or the other though neither of them are to be what they claim if youre lookin to get silly you better go back to from where you came because the cops dont need you and man they expect the same now all the authorities they just stand around and boast how they blackmailed the sergeant at arms into leaving his post and picking up angel who just arrived here from the coast who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost i started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff everybody said theyd stand behind me when the game got rough but the joke was on me there was nobody even there to call my bluff im going back to new york city i do believe ive had enough well i thought that the rain would cool things down but it looks like it dont id like to get you to change your mind but it looks like you wont from now on ill be busy aint goin nowhere fast im just glad its over and im seeing the real you at last well didnt i risk my neck for you didnt i take chances didnt i rise above it all for you the most unfortunate circumstances well i have had some rotten nights didnt think that they would pass im just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last im hungry and im irritable and im tired of this bag of tricks at one time there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix well i sailed through the storm strapped to the mast but the time has come and im seeing the real you at last when i met you baby you didnt show no visible scars you could ride like annie oakley you could shoot like belle starr well i dont mind a reasonable amount of trouble trouble always comes to pass but all i care about now is that im seeing the real you at last well im gonna quit this baby talk now i guess i should have known i got troubles i think maybe you got troubles i think maybe wed better leave each other alone whatever you gonna do please do it fast im still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last what good am i if im like all the rest if i just turn away when i see how youre dressed if i shut myself off so i cant hear you cry what good am i what good am i if i know and dont do if i see and dont say if i look right through you if i turn a deaf ear to the thunderin sky what good am i what good am i while you softly weep and i hear in my head what you say in your sleep and i freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try what good am i what good am i then to others and me if ive had every chance and yet still fail to see if my hands are tied must i not wonder within who tied them and why and where must i have been what good am i if i say foolish things and i laugh in the face of what sorrow brings and i just turn my back while you silently die what good am i down the street the dogs are barkin and the day is a gettin dark as the night comes in a fallin the dogsll lose their bark an the silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind for im one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind from the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes they start to fade as i turn my head back to the room where my love and i have laid an i gaze back to the street the sidewalk and the sign and im one too many mornings an a thousand miles behind its a restless hungry feeling that dont mean no one no good when evrything im a sayin you can say it just as good youre right from your side im right from mine were both just one too many mornings an a thousand miles behind forgetful heart lost your power of recall every little detail you dont remember at all the times we knew who would remember better then you forgetful heart we laughed and had a good time you and i its been so long now youre content to let the days go by when you were there you were the answer to my prayer forgetful heart we loved with all the love that life can give what can i say without you its so hard to live cant take much more why cant we love like we did before forgetful heart like a walking shadow in my brain all night long i lay awake and listen to the sound of pain the door has closed forevermore if indeed there ever was a door ill remember you when ive forgotten all the rest you to me were true you to me were the best when there is no more you cut to the core quicker than anyone i knew when im all alone in the great unknown ill remember you ill remember you at the end of the trail i had so much left to do i had so little time to fail theres some people that you dont forget even though youve only seen m one time or two when the roses fade and im in the shade ill remember you didnt i didnt i try to love you didnt i didnt i try to care didnt i sleep didnt i weep beside you with the rain blowing in your hair ill remember you when the wind blows through the piney wood it was you who came right through it was you who understood though id never say that i done it the way that youd have liked me to in the end my dear sweet friend ill remember you seen the arrow on the doorpost saying this land is condemned all the way from new orleans to jerusalem i traveled through east texas where many martyrs fell and i know no one can sing the blues like blind willie mctell well i heard that hoot owl singing as they were taking down the tents the stars above the barren trees were his only audience them charcoal gypsy maidens can strut their feathers well but nobody can sing the blues like blind willie mctell see them big plantations burning hear the cracking of the whips smell that sweet magnolia blooming see the ghosts of slavery ships i can hear them tribes a moaning hear that undertakers bell nobody can sing the blues like blind willie mctell theres a woman by the river with some fine young handsome man hes dressed up like a squire bootlegged whiskey in his hand theres a chain gang on the highway i can hear them rebels yell and i know no one can sing the blues like blind willie mctell well god is in his heaven and we all want whats his but power and greed and corruptible seed seem to be all that there is im gazing out the window of the st james hotel and i know no one can sing the blues like blind willie mctell of war and peace the truth just twists its curfew gull just glides upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides with his candle lit into the sun though its glow is waxed in black all except when neath the trees of eden the lamppost stands with folded arms its iron claws attached to curbs neath holes where babies wail though it shadows metal badge all and all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow no sound ever comes from the gates of eden the savage soldier sticks his head in sand and then complains unto the shoeless hunter whos gone deaf but still remains upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails heading for the gates of eden with a time rusted compass blade aladdin and his lamp sits with utopian hermit monks sidesaddle on the golden calf and on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh all except inside the gates of eden relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings to those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings and i try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings there are no kings inside the gates of eden the motorcycle black madonna two wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream as he weeps to wicked birds of prey who pick up on his bread crumb sins and there are no sins inside the gates of eden the kingdoms of experience in the precious wind they rot while paupers change possessions each one wishing for what the other has got and the princess and the prince discuss whats real and what is not it doesnt matter inside the gates of eden the foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine as friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign leaving men wholly totally free to do anything they wish to do but die and there are no trials inside the gates of eden at dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams with no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one means at times i think there are no words but these to tell whats true and there are no truths outside the gates of eden aint it just like the night to play tricks when youre tryin to be so quiet we sit here stranded though were all doin our best to deny it and louise holds a handful of rain temptin you to defy it lights flicker from the opposite loft in this room the heat pipes just cough the country music station plays soft but theres nothing really nothing to turn off just louise and her lover so entwined and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind in the empty lot where the ladies play blindmans bluff with the key chain and the all night girls they whisper of escapades out on the d train we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight ask himself if its him or them thats really insane louise shes all right shes just near shes delicate and seems like the mirror but she just makes it all too concise and too clear that johannas not here the ghost of lectricity howls in the bones of her face where these visions of johanna have now taken my place now little boy lost he takes himself so seriously he brags of his misery he likes to live dangerously and when bringing her name up he speaks of a farewell kiss to me hes sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all muttering small talk at the wall while im in the hall how can i explain oh its so hard to get on and these visions of johanna they kept me up past the dawn inside the museums infinity goes up on trial voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while but mona lisa musta had the highway blues you can tell by the way she smiles see the primitive wallflower freeze when the jelly faced women all sneeze hear the one with the mustache say jeeze i cant find my knees oh jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule but these visions of johanna they make it all seem so cruel the peddler now speaks to the countess whos pretending to care for him sayin name me someone thats not a parasite and ill go out and say a prayer for him but like louise always says ya cant look at much can ya man as she herself prepares for him and madonna she still has not showed we see this empty cage now corrode where her cape of the stage once had flowed the fiddler he now steps to the road he writes evrythings been returned which was owed on the back of the fish truck that loads while my conscience explodes the harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain and these visions of johanna are now all that remain the guilty undertaker sighs the lonesome organ grinder cries the silver saxophones say i should refuse you the cracked bells and washed out horns blow into my face with scorn but its not that way i wasnt born to lose you i want you i want you i want you so bad honey i want you the drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep and the saviors who are fast asleep they wait for you and i wait for them to interrupt me drinkin from my broken cup and ask me to open up the gate for you i want you i want you i want you so bad honey i want you how all my fathers theyve gone down true love theyve been without it but all their daughters put me down cause i dont think about it well i return to the queen of spades and talk with my chambermaid she knows that im not afraid to look at her she is good to me and theres nothing she doesnt see she knows where id like to be but it doesnt matter i want you i want you i want you so bad honey i want you now your dancing child with his chinese suit he spoke to me i took his flute no i wasnt very cute to him was i but i did it though because he lied because he took you for a ride and because time was on his side and because i    i want you i want you i want you so bad honey i want you our conversation was short and sweet it nearly swept me off a my feet and im back in the rain oh oh and you are on dry land you

them to you when youre asleep god knows theres a river god knows how to make it flow god knows you aint gonna be taking nothing with you when you go god knows theres a purpose god knows theres a chance god knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance god knows theres a heaven god knows its out of sight god knows we can get all the way from here to there even if weve got to walk a million miles by candlelight i cant wait wait for you to change your mind its late im trying to walk the line well its way past midnight and there are people all around some on their way up some on their way down the air burns and im trying to think straight and i dont know how much longer i can wait im your man im trying to recover the sweet love that we knew you understand that my heart cant go on beating without you well your loveliness has wounded me im reeling from the blow i wish i knew what it was keeps me loving you so im breathing hard standing at the gate but i dont know how much longer i can wait skies are grey im looking for anything that will bring a happy glow night or day it doesnt matter where i go anymore i just go if i ever saw you coming i dont know what i would do id like to think i could control myself but it isnt true thats how it is when things disintegrate and i dont know how much longer i can wait im doomed to love you ive been rolling through stormy weather im thinking of you and all the places we could roam together its mighty funny the end of time has just begun oh honey after all these years youre still the one while im strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind i left my life with you somewhere back there along the line i thought somehow that i would be spared this fate but i dont know how much longer i can wait in the time of my confession in the hour of my deepest need when the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed theres a dyin voice within me reaching out somewhere toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair dont have the inclination to look back on any mistake like cain i now behold this chain of events that i must break in the fury of the moment i can see the masters hand in every leaf that trembles in every grain of sand oh the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way to ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay i gaze into the doorway of temptations angry flame and every time i pass that way i always hear my name then onward in my journey i come to understand that every hair is numbered like every grain of sand i have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night in the violence of a summers dream in the chill of a wintry light in the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space in the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face i hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea sometimes i turn theres someone there other times its only me i am hanging in the balance of the reality of man like every sparrow falling like every grain of sand well your railroad gate you know i just cant jump it sometimes it gets so hard you see im just sitting here beating on my trumpet with all these promises you left for me but where are you tonight sweet marie well i waited for you when i was half sick yes i waited for you when you hated me well i waited for you inside of the frozen traffic when you knew i had some other place to be now where are you tonight sweet marie well anybody can be just like

she showed them to the people from next door and she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun and these things you called a good old fashioned war oh good old fashioned war then the letters ceased to come for a long time they did not come they ceased to come for about ten months or more then a letter finally came saying go down and meet the train your sons a coming home from the war she smiled and went right down she looked everywhere around but she could not see her soldier son in sight but as all the people passed she saw her son at last when she did she could hardly believe her eyes oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off and he wore a metal brace around his waist he whispered kind of slow in a voice she did not know while she couldnt even recognize his face oh lord not even recognize his face oh tell me my darling son pray tell me what they done how is it you come to be this way he tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move and the mother had to turn her face away dont you remember ma when i went off to war you thought it was the best thing i could do i was on the battleground you were home    acting proud you wasnt there standing in my shoes oh and i thought when i was there god what am i doing here im a tryin to kill somebody or die tryin but the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close and i saw that his face looked just like mine oh lord just like mine and i couldnt help but think through the thunder rolling and stink that i was just a puppet in a play and through the roar and smoke this string is finally broke and a cannonball blew my eyes away as he turned away to walk his ma was still in shock at seein the metal brace that helped him stand but as he turned to go he called his mother close
