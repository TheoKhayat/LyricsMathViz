all you want to do is believe her and tonight youll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through oh she can take you but if she wants to break you shes gonna find out that aint so easy to do and no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run whoa oh shes the one shes the one oh oh and just one kiss shes fill them long summer nights with her tenderness that secret pact you made back when her love could save you from the bitterness oh shes the one oh shes the one oh shes the one oh shes the one oh shes the one oh shes the one in my dreams our love was lost i

refusal and then surrender in the tunnels uptown the rats own dream guns him down as shots echo down them hallways in the night no one watches when the ambulance pulls away or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light outside the streets on fire in a real death waltz between whats flesh and whats fantasy and the poets down here dont write nothing at all they just stand back and let it all be and
