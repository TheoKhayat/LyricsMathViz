she fell i wrote about the constitution and defended it well and in the face of ignorance and resistance i wrote financial systems into existence and when my prayers to god were met with indifference i picked up a pen i wrote my own deliverance in the eye of a hurricane there is quiet for just a moment a yellow sky i was twelve when my mother died she was holding me we were sick and she was

time and if we get this right were gonna teach em how to say goodbye you and i mister president they will say youre weak no they will see were strong your position is so unique so ill use it to move them along why do you have to say goodbye if i say goodbye the nation learns to move on it outlives me when im gone like the scripture says everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid theyll be safe in the nation weve made i wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree a moment alone in the shade at home in this nation weve made one last time one last time though in reviewing the incidents of my administration i am unconscious of intentional error i am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that i may have committed many errors i shall also carry with me the hope that my country will view them with indulgence and that after forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion as i myself must soon be to the mansions of rest i anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which i promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of good laws under a free government the ever favorite object of my heart and the happy reward as i trust of our mutual cares labors and dangers one last time george washingtons going home teach em how to say goodbye george washingtons going home you and i george washingtons going home going home george washingtons going home

shot him theres a million things i havent done but just you wait whats your name man alexander hamilton the issue on the table a petition from a quaker delegation in philadelphia calling on congress to end the african slave trade and abolish slavery in all its forms this petition was written and signed by benjamin franklin it cannot go ignored if this comes to a vote in congress what is the white houses position secretary jefferson you first tread lightly sir the constitution clearly states that the states have to wait until eighteen oh eight to debate on whether to end the slave trade and whether or not you want it guys that is the final compromise we made sir wait but for a second let us say that we can legislate unanimous emancipation freedom reigns and yes its great we cannot cure prejudice or righteous desperate hate so back to africa or do they get a separate state in one thousand, seven hundred and eighty four i tried to float banning slavery in the west my notion didnt get a single vote slaverys a sin its growing like a cancer but we cant address the question if we do not have an answer is it my turn good plantation states are packed with promise makers do you realize the precious time these legislators wasted institutionalizing slavery only multiplies our troubles wait till the 1800s and their population doubles you all know this is the stain on our soul and democracy a land of the free no its not its hypocrisy to subjugate dehumanize a race call em property and say that we are powerless to stop it can you not foresee sir even you you have hundreds of slaves whose descendants will curse our names when were safe in our graves how will the south find labor for its businesses how will thomas jefferson find his next mistresses how dare you yet still people follow like lemmings all your hemming and hawing while youre hee hawing with sally hemings thats enough well you asked how i feel i dont pretend to know the answer but the question is real if i may mr president madison lets take this moment to establish a precedent first of all sir we wont involve you in this imagine this debate with all of congress its ruinous ill reassure the south one thousand, eight hundred and eight is still the year that was agreed upon that buys us time and assuages fear ill tell the north that on january 1st of that year well ban importation handling the worst once i get all this agreed upon ill pick up a pen and introduce a notion never to discuss this again mr president hamilton if we support emancipation every single slave owner will demand compensation and as for slandering jefferson with talk of mistresses do you really wanna do you really wanna have that conversation no madison execute your plan to the letter lets hope the next generation thinks of something better i saved every letter you wrote me from the moment i read them i knew you were mine you said you were mine i thought you were mine do you know what angelica said when we saw your first letter arrive she said be careful with that one love he will do what it takes to survive you and your words flooded my senses your sentences left me defenseless you built me palaces out of
