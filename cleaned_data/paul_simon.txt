the line you got to fill out a form first and then you wait in the line buddah and moses and all the noses from narrow to flat had to stand in the line just to glimpse the divine what you think about that well it seems like our fate to suffer and wait for the knowledge we seek its all his design no one cuts in the line no one here likes a sneak you got to fill out a form first and then you wait in the line you got to fill out a form first and then you wait in the line after you climb up the ladder of time the lord god is here face to face in the vastness of space your words disappear and you feel like swimming in an ocean of love and the current is strong but all that remains when you try to explain is a fragment of song lord is it be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do lord be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do be bop a lu la it was a slow day and the sun was beating on the soldiers by the side of the road there was a bright light a shattering of shop windows the bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio these are the days of miracle and wonder this is the long distance call the way the camera follows us in slo mo the way we look to us all the way we look to a distant constellation thats dying in a corner of the sky these are the days of miracle and wonder and dont cry baby dont cry dont cry it was a dry wind and it swept across the desert and it curled into the circle of birth and the dead sand falling on the children the mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth these are the days of miracle and wonder this is the long distance call the way the camera follows us in slo mo the way we look to us all oh yeah the way we look to a distant constellation thats dying in a corner of the sky these are the days of miracle and wonder and dont cry baby dont cry dont cry its a turn around jump shot its everybody jump start its every generation throws a hero up the pop charts medicine is magical and magical is art the boy in the bubble and the baby with the baboon heart and i believe these are the days of lasers in the jungle lasers in the jungle somewhere staccato signals of constant information a loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires and baby these are the days of miracle and wonder this is the long distance call the way the camera follows us in slo mo the way we look to us all oh yeah the way we look to a distant constellation thats dying in a corner of the sky these are the days of miracle and wonder and dont cry baby dont cry dont cry dont cry manys the time ive been mistaken and many times confused yes and often felt forsaken and certainly misused but im all right im all right im just weary to my bones still you dont expect to be bright and bon vivant so far away from home so far away from home and i dont know a soul whos not been battered i dont have a friend who feels at ease i dont know a dream thats not been shattered or driven to its knees but its all right its all right weve lived so well so long still when i think of the road were traveling on i wonder what went wrong i cant help it i wonder what went wrong and i dreamed i was dying and i dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly and looking back down at me smiled reassuringly and i dreamed i was flying and high up above my eyes could clearly see the statue of liberty sailing away to sea and i dreamed i was flying we come on the ship they call the mayflower we come on the ship that sailed the moon we come in the ages most uncertain hour and sing an american tune but its all right its all right you cant be forever blessed still tomorrows going to be another working day and im trying to get some rest thats all im trying to get some rest old friends old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends a newspaper blowin through the grass falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends old friends winter companions the old men lost in their overcoats waiting for the sun the sounds of the city sifting through trees settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends can you imagine us years from today sharing a parkbench quietly how terribly strange to be seventy old friends memory brushes the same years silently sharing the same fears well im accustomed to a smooth ride or maybe im a dog whos lost its bite i dont expect to be treated like a fool no more i dont expect to sleep through the night some people say a lies a lies a lie but i say why why deny the obvious child why deny the obvious child and in remembering a road sign i am remembering a girl when i was young and we said these songs are true these days are ours these tears are free and hey the cross is in the ballpark the cross is in the ballpark we had a lot of fun we had a lot of money we had a little son and we thought wed call him sonny sonny gets married and moves away sonny has a baby and bills to pay sonny gets sunnier day by day by day by day ive been waking up at sunrise ive been following the light across my room i watch the night receive the room of my day some people say the sky is just the sky but i say why deny the obvious child why deny the obvious child sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself how its strange that some roots are like cages sonnys yearbook from high school is down on the shelf and he idle thumbs through the pages some have died some have fled from themselves or struggled from here to get there sonny wanders beyond his interior walls runs his hands through his thinning brown hair im accustomed to a smoother ride or maybe im a dog whos lost its bite i dont expect to be treated like a fool no more i dont expect to sleep the night some people say a lie is just a lie but i say the cross is in the ballpark why deny the obvious child i hear the drizzle of the rain like a memory it falls soft and warm continuing tapping on my roof and walls and from the shelter of my mind through the window of my eyes i gaze beyond the rain drenched streets to england where my heart lies my minds distracted and diffused my thoughts are many miles away they lie with you when youre asleep and kiss you when you start your day and a song i was writing is left undone i dont know why i spend my time writing songs i cant believe with words that tear and strain to rhyme and so you see i have come to doubt all that i once held as true i stand alone without beliefs the only truth i know is you and as i watch the drops of rain weave their weary paths and die i know that i am like the rain there but for the grace of you go i i met my old lover on the street last night she seemed so glad to see me i just smiled and we talked about some old times and we drank ourselves some beers still crazy after all these years oh still crazy after all these years im not the kind of man who tends to socialize i seem to lean on old familiar ways and i aint no fool for love songs that whisper in my ears still crazy after all these years oh still crazy after all these years four in the morning crapped out yawning longing my life away ill never worry why should i its all gonna fade now i sit by my window and i watch the cars i fear ill do some damage one fine day but i would not be convicted by a jury of my peers still crazy after all these years oh still crazy still crazy still crazy after all these years let us be lovers well marry our fortunes together ive got some real estate here in my bag so we bought a pack of cigarettes and mrs wagners pies and we walked off to look for america cathy i said as we boarded a greyhound in pittsburgh michigan seems like a dream to me now it took me four days to hitchhike from saginaw ive gone to look for america laughing on the bus playing games with the faces she said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy i said be careful his bowtie is really a camera toss me a cigarette i think theres one in my raincoat we smoked the last one an hour ago so i looked at the scenery she read her magazine and the moon rose over an open field cathy im lost i said though i knew she was sleeping and im empty and aching and i dont know why counting the cars on the new jersey turnpike theyve all come to look for america all come to look for america all come to look for america i was reading a magazine and thinking of a rock and roll song the year was one thousand, nine hundred and fifty four and i hadnt been playing that long when a man came on the radio and this is what he said he said i hate to break it to his fans but johnny ace is dead yeah yeah yeah well i really wasnt such a johnny ace fan but i felt bad all the same so i sent away for his photograph and i waited till it came it came all the way from texas with a sad and simple face and they signed it on the bottom from the late great johnny ace yeah yeah yeah it was the year of the beatles it was the year of the stones it was nineteen one thousand, nine hundred and sixty four i was living in london with the girl from the summer before it was the year of the beatles it was the year of the stones a year

came up and asked me if id heard john lennon had died and the two of us went to this bar and we stayed to close the place and every song we played was for the late great johnny ace yeah yeah yeah yesterday it was my birthday i hung one more year on the line i should be depressed my lifes a mess but im having a good time ive been loving and loving and loving im exhausted from loving so well i

vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence in restless dreams i walked alone narrow streets of cobblestone neath the halo of a street lamp i turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking

silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never share and no one dared disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls and whispered in the sounds of silence over the mountain down in the valley lives a former talk show host everybody knows his name he says

trembling bed the spider resumes the rhythm of his golden tread and all of these spirit voices rule the night he was my brother five years older than i he was my brother twenty three years old the day he died freedom writer they cursed my brother to his face go home outsider this towns gonna be your buryin place he was singin on his knees an angry mob trailed along they shot my brother dead because he hated what was wrong he was my brother tears cant bring him back to me he was my brother and he died so his brothers could be free he died so his brothers could be free begin again no easy trick without a guide or walking stick begin before the bells of twilight peal downhill town the road ahead spiral as a serpents bed a teaspoon of desire for my meal i trade my tears to ask the lord for proof of love if only for the consolation of gazing at the stars above amen amen amen the road is steep the air is thin i hear a voice inside my skin dont be afraid your days wont end with night feel the sun drink the rain let your body heal its pain bathe beneath a waterfall of light i trade my tears to ask the lord for proof of love if only for the explanation that tells me what my dreams are made of amen amen the valley below an ocean of debris i ask the lord for proof of love love is all i seek love is all i seek and when at times my words desert me music is the tongue i speak i rest my head beside a white oak tree no deadly nightshade belladonna dare lay a leaf on me silent night still as prayer darkness fills with light love on earth is everywhere i was having this discussion in a taxi heading downtown rearranging my position on this friend of mine who had a little bit of a breakdown i said breakdowns come and breakdowns go so what are you going to do about it thats what id like to know you dont feel you could love me but i feel you could it was in the early morning hours when i fell into a phone call believing i had supernatural powers i slammed into a brick wall i said hey is this my problem is this my fault if thats the way its going to be im going to call the whole thing to a halt you dont feel you could love me but i feel you could you dont feel you could love me but i feel you could i was walking down the street when i thought i heard this voice say say aint we walking down the same street together on the very same day i said hey senorita thats astute i said why dont we get together and call ourselves an institute you dont feel you could love me but i feel you could you dont feel you could love me but i feel you could i was having this discussion in a taxi heading downtown the smartest people in the world had gathered in los angeles to analyze our love affair and possibly unscramble us and we sat among our photographs examined every one and in the end we compromised and met the morning sun maybe i think too much maybe i think too much maybe i think too much maybe i think too much they say the left side of the brain dominates the right and the right side has to labor through the long and speechless night and in the night my father came to me and held me to his chest he said theres not much more that you can do go on and get some rest and i said yeah maybe i think too much maybe i think too much maybe i think too much maybe i think too much soon our fortunes will be made my darling and we leave this loathsome little town silver bells jingling from your black lizard boots my baby silver foil to trim your wedding gown its true the tools of love wear down time passes a mind wanders it seems mindless but it does sometimes i see your face as if through reading glasses and your smile seems softer than it was proof some people gonna call you up tell you something that you already know proof sane people go crazy on you say no man that was not the deal we made i got to go i got to go faith faith is an island in the setting sun but proof yes proof is the bottom line for everyone my face my race dont matter anymore my sex my cheques accepted at the door proof some people gonna call you up tell you something that you already know proof sane people go crazy on you say no man that was not the deal we made i got to i got to go faith faith is an island in the setting sun but proof yes proof is the bottom line for everyone half moon hiding in the clouds my darling and the sky is flecked with signs of hope raise your weary wings against the rain my baby wash your tangled curls with gamblers soap proof some people gonna call you up tell you something that you already know proof sane people go crazy on you say no man that was not the deal we made i got to i got to i got to faith faith is an island in the setting sun but proof yes proof is the bottom line for everyone i am heading for a time of quiet when my restlessness is past and i can lie down on my blanket and release my fists at last i am heading for a time of solitude of peace without illusions when the perfect circle marries all beginnings and conclusions and when they say that youre not good enough well the answer is youre not but who are they or what is it that eats at what youve got with the hunger of ambition for the change inside the purse they are handcuffs on the soul my friends handcuffs on the soul and worse i am heading for a place of quiet where the sage and sweet grass grow by a lake of sacred water from the mountains melted snow
