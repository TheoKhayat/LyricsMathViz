begun on the docks near notre dame four frightened gypsies slid silently under the docks near notre dame but a trap had been laid for the gypsies and they gazed up in fear and alarm at a figure whose clutches were iron as much as the bells the bells of notre dame kyrie eleison judge claude frollo longed to purge the world of vice and sin kyrie eleison and he saw corruption evrywhere except within
