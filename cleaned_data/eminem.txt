daddy couldnt buy em ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying cause daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom and at the time every house that we lived in either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back on the chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of eight mile on novara and thats when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me then you started seeing daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it and you and laney were to young to understand it papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand cause

now stick it in i aint never giving in again caution to the wind complete freedom look at these rappers how i treat them so why the fuck would i join em when i beat em yeah they call me a freak cause i like to spit on these pussies fore i eat them man get these whack cocksuckers off stage where the fuck is kanye when you need him snatch the mic from him bitch imma let you finish in a minute yeah that rap was tight but im bout to spit the greatest verse of all time so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones but im afraid that it aint gonna make no difference when i rip this stage and tear it in half tonight its an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd you can see the sparks from hot metal cold hearted from the day i bogarted the game i so started to rock fellow when im not even in my harshest you can still get roasted cause marsh is not mellow til im toppling from the top im not going to stop im standing on my monopoly board that means im on top of my game and it dont stop til my hip dont hop anymore when youre so good that you cant say it cause it aint even cool for you to sound cocky anymore people just get sick cause you spit these fools cant drool or dribble a drop anymore and you can never break my stride you never slow the momentum at any moment im about to blow youll never take my pride killing the flow slow venom and the opponent is getting no mercy mark my words aint letting up relentless i smell blood i dont give a fuck keep giving them hell where was you when i fell and needed help up you get no love its a little too late to say that youre sorry now oh you kicked me when i was down but what you say just dont hurt me yeah thats right it dont hurt me and i don need you no more dont wanna see you no more ha bitch you get no love you showed me nothing but hate yeah you ran me into the ground but what comes around goes around and you dont hurt me thats right you dont hurt me and i dont need you no more dont want to see you no more ha bitch you get no love no love no love no love ha bitch you get no love no love no love and i dont need you no more ha bitch you get no love cause sometimes you just feel tired you feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up but you gotta search within you you gotta find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up and not be a quitter no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse til i collapse im spilling these raps long as you feel em til the day that i drop youll never say that im not killing em cause when i am not then im a stop pinning them and i am not hip hop and im just not eminem subliminal thoughts when im stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop amoxicillin is just not real enough the criminal cop killing hip hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners youre coming with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us you hear it a lot lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up for shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck til the roof comes off till the lights go out til my legs give out cant shut my mouth til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps im a rip this shit till my bone collapse til the roof comes off till the lights go out til my legs give out cant shut my mouth til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps im a rip this shit till my bone collapse music is like magic theres a certain feeling you get when youre real and you spit and people are feeling your shit this is your moment and every single minute you spittin trying to hold onto it cause you may never get it again so while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can and when your run is over just admit when its at its end cause im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in i got a list heres the order of my list that its in it goes reggie jay z tupac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy so when im not put on this list the shit does not offend me thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me you hate it but you know respect youve got to give me the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me til the roof comes off till the lights go out til my legs give out cant shut my mouth til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps im a rip this shit till my bone collapse til the roof comes off till the lights go out til my legs give out cant shut my mouth til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps im a rip this shit till my bone collapse soon as a verse starts i eat at an mcs heart what is he thinking enough to not go against me smart and its absurd how people hang on every word ill probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve but ill never be served my spot is forever reserved if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse thats why im clever when i put together every verse my thoughts are sporadic i act like im an addict i rap like im addicted to smack like im kim mathers but i dont want to go forth and back in constant battles the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers so this is like a full blown attack im launching at em the track is on some battling raps who want some static cause i dont really think that the fact that im slim matters a plaque of platinum status is whack if im not the baddest til the roof comes off till the lights go out til my legs give out cant shut my mouth til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps im a rip this shit till my bone collapse til the roof comes off till the lights go out til my legs give out cant shut my mouth til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps im a rip this shit till my bone collapse until the roof until the roof the roof comes off the roof comes off until my legs until my legs give out from underneath me underneath me i i will not fall i will stand tall feels like no one can beat me now everybody from the three hundred and thirteen put your motha fuckin hands up and follow me now everybody from the three hundred and thirteen

to life feels like a close its coming to fuck am i gonna do its too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know sometimes i feel like all i ever do is find different ways to word the same old song ever since i came along from the day the song called hi my name is dropped started thinking my name was fault cause anytime things went wrong i was the one who they would blame it on the media made me the equivalent of a modern day genghis khan tried to argue it was only entertainment dawg gangsta naw courageous balls had to change my style they said im way too soft and i sound like az and nas out came the claws and the fangs been out since then but up until the instant that ive been against it it was ingrained in me that i wouldnt amount to a shitstain i thought no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught do i really belong in this game i pondered i just wanna play my part should i make waves or not so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on and i dont wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform i was raised upon but sometimes you gotta take a loss and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off and keep pluggin its your only outlet and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah feel like ive already said this a kabillion eighty times how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme what i really wanna say is is there anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are i was afraid to make a single sound afraid i will never find a way out out out afraid i never before i didnt wanna go another round an angry mans power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tip toe love run out of excuses with every word so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is here guts over fear i shall not tear for all the times i let you push me around and let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over fear feels like a close its coming to fuck am i gonna do its too late to start over this is the only thing i thing i know i know what it was like i was there once single parents hate your appearance did you struggle to find your place in this world and the pain spawns all the anger on but it wasnt until i put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on that i made a spark started to spit hard as shit learned how to harness it while the reins were off and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck haters started to appreciate my art and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain ive caused but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone and the lights go out in the trailer park and the window that was closing and theres nowhere else i can go with flows in and im frozen cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from just a bunch of playful songs that i made for fun so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song but id rather make not afraid two than making another mothafuckin we made you uh now i dont wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise pray to god i just opened enough eyes later on gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong and enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt cause i cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt just having to balance my damn self but on eggshells i was made to walk but thank you ma cause that gave me the strength to cause shady mania so many empty that stadium at least i made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done so this is for every kid who alls they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song everything youre scared to say dont be afraid to say no more from this day on forward just let them a holes talk take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when im gone and to think i was gone i was afraid to make a single sound afraid i will never find a way out out out afraid i never before i didnt wanna go another round an angry mans power will shut you up trip wires fill this house with tip toe love run out of excuses with every word so here i am and i will not run guts over fear the time is here guts over fear i shall not tear for all the times i let you push me around and let you keep me down now i got guts over fear guts over

take it too far cleaning out my closet and all them other songs but regardless i dont hate you cause ma youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom though far be it for you to be calling my house

away by the state at eight years old and thats when i realized you were sick and it wasnt fixable or changeable and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though but i guess we are who we are headlights shining in the dark night i drive on maybe we took this too far cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though cause you aint even get to witness your grand babys growth but im sorry mama for cleaning out my closet at the time i was angry rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though cause now i know its not your fault and im not making jokes that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time its on the radio and i think of nathan being placed in a home and all the medicine you fed us and how i just wanted you to taste your own but now the

atlas someone ever moved them from me that you could bet your asss if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap them and although one has met their grandma once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers me her and nate we introduced you hugged you and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths

to stay even when im gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die i can hear the drummer drumming and the trumpets someones tryna summon someone i know somethings coming but im running from it to be standing at the summit and plummet how come it wasnt what i thought it was was it too good to be true have nothing get it all but too much of it then lose it again did i swallow hallucinogens cause if not where the hell did it go cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven just choosing to sin even if it means im selling my soul just to be the undisputed again do whatever i gotta do just to win cause i got this motherfucking cloud over my head crown around it thorns on it cracks in it bet you morons didnt think id be back did ya how bout that im somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is something i never bow wowd at i complain about the game i shout and i pout its a love hate but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt even when you bitches are counting me out and i appear to be down for the count only time i ever been out and about is driving around town with my fucking whereabouts in a doubt cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but im not a quitter gotta get up give it all i got or give up spit on shit on stepped on but kept going im tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong cause youre moving onto the next but is the respect gone cause someone told me that kings never die dont give me that sob story liar dont preach to the choir you aint never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer wouldnt even take shit into consideration obliterate anyone in the way i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me but itd actually have to be a fucking blowout to get me to retire tell these new artists that kings never die i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page did it just say ive been upstaged why am i online its driving me crazy im riding shotgun tryna get a gauge on whats hot but im not gonna conform but as days pass in this shit and opinions sway i can hear them say if i stay passionate maybe i can stay jay miraculous comeback as if i went away but detractors just say so much for the renegade someones gonna make me blow my composure here i go again center stage and i feel like im in a cage some want a champion to fall i still wonder why i laugh at em cause why care when im awesome fuck what these cynics say just goes to show that when my backs against the wall and im under attack again that ill act as if im posted up with this pent up rage cause all these plaques in my office on the floor stacked against the door are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin back again cause all the accomplishments accolades awards and trophies just dont mean jack anymore if im here today and gone tomorrow and im not gonna be here to stay even when im gone when i close my eyes through the passage of time kings never die i want it im coming to get it so you son of a bitches dont duck youre gonna get riddick bowed criticsll end up in critical think your shit is dope all youre gonna get is smoked then and i aint stopping till im on top again all alone and on a throne like a token of respect or a homage poem or an ode ive been owed tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard i broke my collarbone and when its my time to go im still not leaving stop for no one i dont know but ive been told an obstacle that blocks your road knock it over time to go for that pot of gold cause they say kings never die just ask jam master jay they just grow wings and they fly so hands up reach for the sky try to hold up and prolong these moments cause in a blink of an eye theyll be over tryna secure your legacy like shakur and ensure nobodys ever gonna be what you were so before youre leaving this earth you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk deacon of words syllable genius at work plus im thinking that theyre mistaking my kindness for weakness kill em with meanness i went from powdered milk and farina to flipping burgers on the grill for some peanuts from gilberts to arenas call me gilbert arenas still appeal to the dreamers i made it to the silver screen where rockys still what the theme is khalil on the beat cause making the beat aint the same feeling to me as killing the beat is so fulfilling to me is what filling a seat is that sound vomit thirst and how common underground commons eat outsider stomach growl throbbing hunger out rhyming everyone god just give me one shot i swear that i wont let you down ima be around forever entertain even in the
