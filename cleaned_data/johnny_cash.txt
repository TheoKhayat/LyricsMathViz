little farther down the line far from folsom prison thats where i want to stay and id let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away well i woke up sunday morning with no way to hold my head that didnt hurt and the beer i had for breakfast wasnt bad so i had one more for dessert then i fumbled in my closet through my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt then i washed my face and combed my hair and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day id smoked my mind the night before with cigarettes and songs id been picking but i lit my first and watched a small kid playing with a can that he was kicking then i walked across the street and caught the sunday smell of someones frying chicken and lord it took me back to something that id lost somewhere somehow along the way on a sunday morning sidewalk im wishing lord that i was stoned cause theres something in a sunday that makes a body feel alone and theres nothing short a dying thats half as lonesome as the sound of the sleeping city sidewalk and sunday morning coming down in the park i saw a daddy with a laughing little girl that he was swinging and i stopped beside a sunday school and listened to the songs they were singing then i headed down the street and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing and it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams of yesterday on a sunday morning sidewalk im wishing lord that i was stoned cause theres something in a sunday that makes a body feel alone and theres nothing short a dying thats half as lonesome as the sound of the sleeping city sidewalk and sunday morning

for the shelf so it stood ninety years on the floor it was taller by half than the old man himself though it weighed not a pennyweight more it was bought on the morn of the day that he was born and was always his treasure and pride but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died ninety years without slumbering his life seconds numbering it stopped short never to go again when the old man died my grandfather said that of those he could hire not a servant so faithful he found for it wasted no time and had but one desire at the close of each week to be wound and it kept in its place not a frown upon its face and its hands never hung by its side but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died it rang and alarmed in the dead of the night an alarm that for years had been dumb and we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight that his hour for departure had come still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime as we silently stood by his side but it stopped short never to go again when the old man died ninety years without slumbering his life seconds numbering it stopped short never to go again when the old man died some glad morning when this life is oer ill fly away to that home on gods celestial shore ill fly away ill fly away oh glory ill fly away when i die hallelujah by and by ill fly away just a few more weary days and then ill fly

the peoples trunk constable had to come and take him away sheriff john stone why dont you leave me alone well i feel so homesick i wanna go home then the cook he caught the fits threw out all of my grits then he took and ate up all of my corn let me go home why dont you let me go home well this is the worst trip since i have been born so hoist up the john b sail drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss within the cup and ill not ask for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine but might i of joves nectar sip i would not change for thine i sent thee late a rosy wreath not so much honring thee as giving it a hope that there it could not withered be but thou thereon didst only breathe and sentst it back to me since when it grows and smells i swear not of itself but thee drink to me only with thine eyes and i will pledge with mine or leave a kiss within the cup and ill not ask for wine the thirst that from the soul doth rise doth ask a drink divine but might i of joves nectar sip i would not change for thine i walked through a county courthouse square on a park bench an old man was sitting there i said your old courthouse is kinda run down he said naw itll do for our little town i said your old flagpole has leaned a little bit and thats a ragged old flag you got hanging on it he said have a seat and i sat down is this the first time youve been to our little town i said i think it is he said i dont like to brag but were kinda proud of that ragged old flag you see we got a little hole in that flag there when washington took it across the delaware and it got powder burned the night francis scott key sat watching it writing say can you see and it got a bad rip in new orleans with packingham and jackson tuggin at its seams and it almost fell at the alamo beside the texas flag but she waved on though she got cut with a sword at chancellorsville and she got cut again at shiloh hill there was robert e lee beauregard and bragg and the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag on flanders field in world war one she got a big hole from a bertha gun she turned blood red in world war two she hung limp and low a time or two she was in korea and vietnam she went where she was sent by uncle sam she waved from our ships upon the briny foam and now theyve about quit waving her back here at home in her own good land here shes been abused shes been burned dishonored denied and refused and the government for which she stands is scandalized throughout the land and shes getting threadbare and wearing thin but shes in good shape for the shape shes in cause shes been through the fire before and i believe she can take a whole lot more so we raise her up every morning we take her down every night we dont let her touch the ground and we fold her up right on second thought i do like to brag cause im mighty proud of that ragged old flag im just a poor wayfaring stranger traveling through this world below there is no sickness no toil nor danger in that bright land to which i go im going there to see my father and all my loved ones whove gone on im just going over jordan im just going over home i know dark clouds will gather round me i know my way is hard and steep but beauteous fields arise before me where gods redeemed their vigils keep im going there to see my mother she said

road again and i cant wait to get on the road again i was a highwayman along the coach roads i did ride with sword and pistol by my side many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five but i am still alive i was a sailor i was born upon the tide and with the sea i did abide i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed but i am living still i was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide a place called boulder on the wild colorado i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below they buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound but i am still around ill always be around and around and around and around and around i fly a starship across the universe divide and when i reach the other side ill find a place to rest my spirit if i can perhaps i may become a highwayman again or i may simply be a single drop of rain but i will remain and ill be back again and again and again and again and again oh come all you young fellers young and so fine seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine itll form as a habit and seep in your soul till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few where the rain never falls the sun never shines its dark as a dungeon way down in the mine well its many a man that ive seen in my day no laughing during the song please its been recorded i know hell dont you know its recorded like a fiend with his dope and a dropper with his wine a man will have less for the lure of the mine and i pray when im dead and the ages shall roll that my body would blacken and turn into coal then ill look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my bones where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double and the pleasures are few where the rain never falls the sun never shines its dark as a dungeon way down in the mine thank you very much thank you very much sorry about that little interruption there but i
