father died and left him a little farm in new england all the long black funeral cars left the scene and the boy was just standing there alone looking at the shiny red tractor him and his daddy used to sit inside and circle the blue fields and grease the night it was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars cause when he looked up they started to slip then he put his head in the crux of his arm and he started to drift drift to the belly of a ship let the ship slide open and he went inside of it and saw his daddy hind the control board streamin beads of light he saw his daddy hind the control board and he was very different tonight cause he was not human he was not human and then the little boys face lit up with such naked joy that the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns white lids white opals seeing everything just a little bit too clearly and he looked around and there was no black ship in sight no black funeral cars nothing except for him the raven and fell on his knees and looked up and cried out no daddy dont leave me here alone take me up daddy to the belly of your ship let the ship slide open and ill go inside of it where youre not human you are not human but nobody heard the boys cry of alarm nobody there cept for the birds around the new england farm and they gathered in all directions like roses they scattered and they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet slit in his nose and all the others went shooting and he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of blake grabbing at his cheeks taking out his neck all his limbs everything was twisted and he said i wont give up wont give up dont let me give up i wont give up come here let me go up fast take me up quick take me

on my knee on the screen and i looked at johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame in the heart of man the waves were coming in like arabian stallions gradually lapping into sea horses he picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat the spoon and let it deep in the veins dip in to the sea to the sea of possibilities it started hardening dip in to the sea to the sea of possibilities it started hardening in my hand and i felt the arrows of desire i put my hand inside his cranium oh we had such a brainiac amour but no more no more i gotta move from my mind to the area

key to the sea of possibilities theres no land but the land looked at my hands and theres a red stream that went streaming through the sands like fingers like arteries like fingers how much fits between the eyes of a horse he lay pressing it against his throat your eyes he opened his throat your eyes his vocal chords started shooting like of a horse mad pituitary glands the scream he made and my heart was so high my heart pitched that nobody heard no one heard that cry no one heard johnny the butterfly flapping in his throat his fingers nobody heard he was on that bed it was like a sea of jelly and so he seized the first his vocal chords shot up possibility like mad pituitary glands it was a black tube he felt himself disintegrate there is nothing happening at all and go inside the black tube so when he looked out into the steep saw this sweet young thing fender one humping on the parking meter leaning on the parking meter in the sheets there was a man dancing around to the

it said it said nothing went to the party very discouraged i watched the litter pile like a wall i looked at the river just couldnt forgive it it was ladened with all kinds of shit still i admit that i didnt say nothing i turned my back walked away got to face the fact that i didnt say nothing everyone was dancing i stood over in the corner i was listening they were saying this and saying that and putting this one down but nothing was delivered nothing good was coming i just stood there i couldnt believe it but i didnt say nothing i walked the floor then i looked away got to face the fact that i didnt say nothing how long how long will we make do maybe its time to break on through gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up gonna get well im gonna do something gonna face the fact gonna give it back and im gonna do something wont hold my tongue wont hold the thought wont hold the card well im gonna do something oh my brain i got to complain you can refrain but im gonna do something how long how long will we make do maybe its time to break on through out in the desert i saw that old cat skinned i saw it floating in the river i saw and no one seemed to mind they sat there they sat there watching the sun i saw it float away and i watched the buildings crumble like dust in the hand and we watched the sun spread its wings and fly away and in the mountains a cry echoes dont say nothing dont say nothing no dont say nothing no this dead city longs to be this dead city longs to be free seven screaming horses melt down in the sun building scenes on empty dreams and smoking them one by one this dead city longs to be this dead city longs to be living is it any wonder theres squalor in the sun with their broken schemes and their lotteries they never get nowhere is it any wonder theyre spitting at the sun gods parasites in abandoned sites and they never have much fun if i was a blind man would you see for me or would you confuse the nature of my blues and refuse a hand to me is it any wonder crying in the sun is it any wonder im crying in the sun well i built my dreams on your empty scenes now im burning them one by one this damn city this dead city immortal city motor city suc cess city longs to be longs to be free free free mother as i write the sun dissolves blood life streaming cross my hand and these words these words hope dashed immortal hope hope streaking the canvas sky blue poles infinitely winding as i write as i write blue poles infinitely winding as i write as i write we joined the long caravan hungry dreaming going west just for work just to get a job and we never got lucky we just forged on and the dust the endless dust like a plague it covered everything hal fell with the fever and mother i did what i could blue poles infinitely winding as i write as i write blue poles infinitely winding as i write as i write we prayed we prayed for rain i never wanted to see the sun again all my dresses you made by hand we left behind on the road hal died in my arms we buried him by the river blue poles infinitely winding as i write as i write blue poles infinitely winding as i write as i write in the straw colored light in light rapidly changing on a life rapidly fading have you seen death singing have you seen death singing with a throat smooth as a lamb yet dry as a branch not snapping he throws back his head and he does not sing a thing mournful have you seen death singing have you seen death singing have you seen death singing in the straw colored light he sings a black embrade and white opals swimming in a childs leather purse have you seen death swimming have you seen death swimming with a throat smooth as a lamb yet dry as a branch not snapping he throws back his head and he does not sing a thing mournful have you seen death singing have you seen death singing have you seen death singing in the straw colored light he sings of youth enraged and the burning of atlanta and these viral times and may ribbons streaming and straw colored curls a turning a mothers vain delight and woe to the sun and woe to the young another hearse is drawn have you seen death singing in the straw colored light
